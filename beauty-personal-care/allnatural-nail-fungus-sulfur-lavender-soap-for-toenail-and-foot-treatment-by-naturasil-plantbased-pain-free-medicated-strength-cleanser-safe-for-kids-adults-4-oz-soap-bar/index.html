This soap is designed to relieve the itching and discomfort of nail fungus, while also aiding in the recovery of damaged areas, offering you both immediate comfort and long-term healing benefits.
Your Ultimate Defense Mechanism: Our specially formulated soap uses sulfur&rsquo;s ability to dry out the skin, creating an environment where nail fungus can&rsquo;t thrive. By reducing moisture, it effectively targets and diminishes fungal infections, setting the stage for healthier skin and nails.
Easy to Use Instructions: Lather with the sulfur soap on all affected areas, allowing it to sit on the nail ailment for several minutes, then rinse and dry thoroughly. Pair with our Naturasil Nail Fungus liquid for best results.
Targeted Application for Optimal Results: Apply the soap at least twice daily for 4-10 days. Depending on the severity, it may take longer. Apply the liquid treatment under and around the nail bed 2-3 times daily until the nail has completely grown out.
Please Note: *** Your affected nail MUST grow completely free of nail bacteria before it is healthy.****
Boost Your Skin and Nail Vitality: Unlock the power of sulfur and lavender for your nail and skin health. This soap not only combats nail fungus but also nourishes and moisturizes the affected areas, promoting healthier nail growth and improved skin condition. It&rsquo;s your daily solution for maintaining strong, healthy nails and soft, supple skin.</p><p>Naturasil Nail Fungus Medicated Soap is made with micronized volcanic Sulfur and pure lavender oil.
