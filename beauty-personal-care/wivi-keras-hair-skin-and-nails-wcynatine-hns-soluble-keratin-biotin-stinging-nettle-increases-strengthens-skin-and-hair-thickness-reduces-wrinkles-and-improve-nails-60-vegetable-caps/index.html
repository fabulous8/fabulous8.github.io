It is a member of the B-vitamin complex and is essential for the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Biotin is particularly important for maintaining healthy skin, hair, and nails. It&rsquo;s key functions include: Hair Skin and Nails Health, Metabolism, Cell Growth and Repair, Blood Sugar Regulation , Pregnancy and Development.
Cynatine is a patented form of solubilized keratin, a protein that is a key structural component of hair, skin, and nails. Keratin is known for its role in maintaining the strength and integrity of these tissues. Cynatine keratin is created through a unique process that involves breaking down natural keratin into smaller, bioavailable molecules. The solubilization process used to create Cynatine involves making the keratin water-soluble, which enhances its absorption by the body. This solubility is particularly advantageous for applications in cosmetic and nutritional products, where the goal is often to improve the health and appearance of hair, skin, and nails.
TRACCS (The Real Amino Acid Chelate System) is a brand of mineral amino acid chelates that are patented by Albion Minerals, a company specializing in mineral amino acid chelates and other mineral forms designed for optimal absorption in the human body. Albion Minerals has developed a unique process for creating chelated minerals, which involves binding minerals to amino acids in a specific manner. The TRAACS chelation process is designed to enhance the bioavailability and absorption of minerals in the body.
Wi-Vi USA has rigorus 3rd party testing that way you know what is on the label is actually in the bottle!</p><p>We believe that true beauty starts from within, and our Kera&rsquo;s Hair, Skin and Nails products are designed to support your beauty goals by providing essential nutrients that your body needs to thrive. Whether you&rsquo;re looking to boost hair growth, encourage skin radiance, or strengthen your nails, Kera&rsquo;s is here to enhance your natural beauty from the inside out. Our Kera&rsquo;s hair, skin, and nails supplements are carefully crafted to address the unique needs of each area. We understand that healthy hair requires a strong foundation, which is why our hair vitamins are formulated with ingredients that nourish and strengthen hair follicles, promote hair growth, and improve overall hair health. Kera&rsquo;s Hair, Skin, and Nail contains a unique, orally-bioavailable form of the keratin – the most common form of protein in your hair, skin and nails – called Cynatine. Research shows that Cynatine enhances the strength and resilience of hair and nail tissue. It has also been shown in clinical trials to reduce wrinkles and improve skin moisture and elasticity. Also included is a special bamboo extract which is rich in natural silica. Silica is extremely important as it optimizes the synthesis of the proteins and other chemical building blocks of your skin, hair and nails. Clinical studies have shown that supplementation with high quality sources of silica, as found in Kera&rsquo;s Hair, Skin, and Nails, reduces skin roughness and increases skin and hair thickness. Women taking silica have also noticed reduced brittleness of their hair and nails. Kera&rsquo;s Hair, Skin, and Nails also provides biotin and essential minerals in their patented TRAACS forms – which are the only true, scientifically-validated chelated minerals available.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71F7+iijTtL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
