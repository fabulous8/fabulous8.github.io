It doesn&rsquo;t penetrate very deep so the process is gradual, mild, and comforting to the scalp&rsquo;s delicate balance of natural oils while still cleansing. This product contains no synthetic detergents, sulfates, salts, or preservatives so patients report almost no drying or over-cleaning.
The cleanser in this product (alkylpolyglucoside) is a sugar-based molecule that has been specially shaped so that debris, old sebum, and residue from other products fits inside it as it foams, gently lifting away all the things that make your hair fall out, stay dry, and get worse with daily abuse. When you rinse the foam out, a remarkable thing happens. The result is hair that is naturally-balanced and easy to care for.
With repeated use, hair is repaired, reconditioned, and ready to resist everyday wear and tear. If your hair is short, you might not notice the long-term improvement, but if your hair is long, you will certainly notice the improvement.

After the Prep has softened the sebum in the follicles, this product gently works its way into the follicles&mldr;just under the surface of the scalp. It doesn&rsquo;t penetrate very deep so the process is gradual, mild, and comforting to the scalp&rsquo;s delicate balance of natural oils while still cleansing. This product contains no synthetic detergents, sulfates, salts, or preservatives so patients report almost no drying or over-cleaning. Even chemically-treated, abused, and over-dried hair damaged by hot tools, blow dryers, and perms comes clean while improving in condition, appearance, body, luster, shine, transparency, and elasticity. The cleanser in this product (alkylpolyglucoside) is a sugar-based molecule that has been specially shaped so that debris, old sebum, and residue from other products fits inside it as it foams, gently lifting away all the things that make your hair fall out, stay dry, and get worse with daily abuse. When you rinse the foam out, a remarkable thing happens. The old sebum stays in solution while the natural conditioning ingredients fall out of the foam and are absorbed into the hair. The result is hair that is naturally-balanced and easy to care for.
