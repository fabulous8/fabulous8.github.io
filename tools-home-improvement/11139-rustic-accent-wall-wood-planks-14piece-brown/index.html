Inspired by Sustainability, Designed for Impact: Crafted with sustainability in mind, our thermo-treated panels invite you to unleash your inner designer. Made in the USA, they offer timeless elegance without the wait, creating lasting impressions in your home.</p><p>Experience the timeless allure of aged wood with our revolutionary thermo-treated wall decor planks, providing the look and feel of 350-year-old reclaimed lumber. Through our patented technology, we eliminate moisture, resins, and bacteria, ensuring a clean and eco-friendly product. No harmful chemicals, bugs, or worries - just sustainable, wall wood paneling, made and grown in the USA. Each plank is meticulously wire brushed to create a captivating wood accent wall texture. With the easy-to-follow installation process, you can effortlessly transform any space, from wall paneling for interior wall, wainscoting to headboards, and even furniture and door trims. To start the installation, select the orientation - horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. Use pre-cut planks as starter and end planks to achieve a seamless look. For the installation, we offer two options: 1) Use the enclosed nail strip and a nail gun equipped with 1"" long and #16 Gauge brad nails. 2) Manual hammer installation by chipping nails from the strip, suitable for high humidity areas. For full-length planks, add two additional nails in the middle. Always leave a hair-sized gap between planks to allow for expansion and contraction. For cutting planks, use a wood saw or utility knife. To mount wall art or shelves, drill holes and use hangers. Ensure that the weight of the items does not exceed 0.5 lbs to avoid strain on the planks. Refrain from using double-sided sticky foam or adhesive, as they may cause the planks to fall over time or lead to warping. But if preferred, apply three thin strips along the planks for added support. Our wood plank walls boast exceptional stability, thanks to the thermo-treatment process that prevents twisting, cupping, and warping. Crafted with precision milling, every plank fits seamlessly together, eliminating the need for gaps between planks during installation. Elevate your wooden wall art decor and create a lasting impression with our thermo-treated decorative planks. Unleash your inner designer, embrace sustainability, and enjoy the beauty of reclaimed wood wall panels without the wait. Upgrade your home with confidence today and let your accent wall wood decor tell a story of timeless elegance!</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tefxRE0-L._AC_SL1200_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://fabulous8.github.io/tools-home-improvement/11177113-goodman-oem-replacement-furnace-vent-air-pressure-switch-2-stage-30-75-wc/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="11177113 - Goodman OEM Replacement Furnace Vent Air Pressure Switch 2 Stage .30 / .75 WC">&larr;
