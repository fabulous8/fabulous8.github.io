It is used to produce an assortment of chemically leavened bread and fried products, and is especially popular as a nutritious hot cereal or a side dish.
OLD FASHION GRITS:- These are the old fashion type grits, not the instant grits. There are no additives in them. They haven&rsquo;t been pre-cooked or fortified in any way. It is just natural corn. True grits like these are literally nothing more than plain white corn that has been ground down to a coarse sand-type texture after most of the husk and germ has been removed.
PREPARATION:- Bring water to boil. Whisk the grits into the water. Simmer for 20-30 minutes. Use 4 cups of water to 1 cup of grits. Add more water if you prefer your grits &ldquo;soupy.&rdquo; Season to taste (salt, pepper, butter, or even cheese).
PREMIUM QUALITY:- Freeze Dried, Dehydrated and Air Dried products are less expensive than wet pack food because you are not paying for all the water.The taste is great, and the nutritional food value is excellent!! Air Drying/Dehydrating allows for natural and additive free foods to be stored effectively for long periods of time. NO additives or preservatives.
SHELF LIFE:- This product comes with a 30 years of shelf life and can be stored almost indefinitely in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.
NOTE:- This item does not have expiration dates on the product but we get only the fresh inventory with a long shelf life. You can enjoy this for a long time. If there are any concerns about shelf life or expiration please do not hesitate to reach out.</p><p>Freeze Dried White Corn Grits | Long Term Storage (30 years shelf life) Emergency Supply | Hiking, Backpacking & Camping | Easy Prep Survival Food | #10 Can / 5 Lbs-
