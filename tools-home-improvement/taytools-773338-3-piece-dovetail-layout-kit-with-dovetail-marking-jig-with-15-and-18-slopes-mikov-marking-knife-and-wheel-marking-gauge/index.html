The hardened steel beam is .310 inches in diameter and 8 inches long. Maximum cutting depth is 7 inches. The beam is black chrome plated to protect against corrosion and to allow easier reading of the mm and SAE graduations.

It will mark dovetails in stock up to 1-1/6" inch thick in 1:5 and 1:8 slopes. Jig is precision CNC machined from solid blank of aluminum and then anodized and will never lose settings.
