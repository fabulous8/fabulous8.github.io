SAFETY FIRST: We have all read numerous horror stories about horrendous saw accidents, but these push blocks for table saw will not allow you to become an additional story; Keep these saw push sticks between your fingers and your cutting tool and work with confidence knowing that all of your fingers and both hands are safe and protected against kickbacks when guiding your stock through cutting blades and cutter heads
FOR MOST MACHINES: 3-inch x 6-inch (7.6cm x 15.2cm) size ensures maximum versatility and is ideal for use with a multitude of machines including radial saws, table saws, router tables, band saws, jointers, and shapers; For professional woodworkers and hobbyists alike to rip plywood, medium-density fiberboard (MDF), and more
SMOOTH, TIGHT-HOLD FRICTION PAD: Black natural foam rubber bottom friction pad holds workpiece tightly; Slip-resistant for a reliable, secure grip and prevents you from scratching your workpiece; Dependably strong hold that makes the block “stick” to your workpiece as you work it through the machine; If pads become soiled with dust, simply wipe clean with your hand or a cloth to regain maximum grip
OFFSET HANDLE: High-visibility orange plastic handle features smooth and rounded edges with an ergonomic and effective angled design that provides a comfortable and steady grip so your wrist and hand are naturally well above the workpiece throughout the cutting process and allows the user to exert precision lateral and vertical force</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mq0kR2AjL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
