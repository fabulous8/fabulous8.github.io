A dual-screw Moxon Vise is an incredibly versatile workbench accessory that is simple to build with the right hardware.
A Moxon vise can stabilize wide and narrow boards with incredible force while various joinery, shaping or carving operations are performed. It raises the workpiece to a more comfortable and ergonomic height. It is highly portable and can be quickly mounted anywhere on a bench or table, and when not in use, easily stowed away on a shelf or hung on a wall.
This Moxon Vise hardware kit is quite economical, yet contains high-quality 3/4-10 threaded rods (NOT Acme threads), nuts, washers and cast knobs. This hardware kit contains everything needed (minus the wood) to make a fully functional Moxon vise.
This kit does not come with detailed plans or measured drawings but includes a comprehensive manual with numerous design considerations allowing you to build a custom Moxon vise that suits your personal needs.
This kit contains 2 each 8 inch 3/4-10 threaded rods (NOT Acme threads), 2 each 4-1/2 inch cast single-prong handles and 4 each 3/4 inch nuts and washers.
