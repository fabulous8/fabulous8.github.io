From the Manufacturer
SharkBite is the push-fit connection system that&rsquo;s really taking hold. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to join copper, CPVC or PEX pipe in any combination - with no soldering, clamps, unions or glue. Just insert the pipe and the stainless steel teeth bite down and grip tight, while a specially formulated O-ring compresses to create a perfect seal. Disassembly is just as fast using the simple disconnect tool. So fittings and valves can be easily changed and reused. They can even be rotated after assembly for easier installation in tight spaces. Get SharkBite, and get a grip on your next plumbing project. These fittings are lead free and meet all requirements for plumbing in California and Vermont.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51a15aTXJuL._AC_SL1000_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
