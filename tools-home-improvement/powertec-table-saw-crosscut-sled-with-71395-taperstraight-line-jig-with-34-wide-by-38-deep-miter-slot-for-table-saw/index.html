This cross cut jig was designed to produce perfectly repeatable and highly accurate cross cuts when using a full-size contractor grade table saw. No matter the type of cut, this tablesaw sled kit performs efficiently and effectively. Large pieces can now be handled much easier and with greater accuracy. The sled comes complete with stops and clamps used to hold the work, safely keeping hands away from the blade. This also gives you more control with less chance of kickbacks. The sled table is cut to fit the individual saw and blade – acting like a zero clearance insert. Sled Features Adjustable 90 degree stop. Easy to read graduations for mistake free set-ups and measurements. Hold down clamps will not deform or bow the table if the clamp bolt is clamped straight. Low friction tape that prevents wear, protects the table and provides seamless transitions and sliding for the platform and/or fence. A high quality flip stop designed to prevent the accumulation of chips and debris without extending the entire width of the fence surface. Introducing the Taper / Straight Line Jig by POWERTEC. This multi-functional woodworking taper jig is designed to make quick, easy and high precision tapered cuts. All-Inclusive, it features everything you need to safely cut long, angled tapers and straight edges along your board and workpiece. It fits tight and securely in any standard 3/8" x 3/4" miter slot and features an ergonomic handle for seamless push-action performance throughout the cutting process.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61sFQ5q3pHL._SL1200_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
