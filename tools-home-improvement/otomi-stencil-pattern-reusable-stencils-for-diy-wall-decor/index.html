Detailed Stenciling instructions with color photos plus Free stencil ($4.95 value) included</p><p>Single overlay Stencil. ALLOVER: sheet 40.6"x27.7", design 36.2"x25.2" Top part stencil is included for FREE! Description We are in love with our Otomi stencil pattern! Inspired by traditional Mexican tribal textiles, this amazing ethnic pattern works great in a nursery, kids room, bedroom or on a headboard or rug. Check out the details of this lovely design, a joyful celebration of life and all its beautiful animals. Why use expensive wallpaper when you can stencil your walls? Reusable stencils save you money and make you feel proud of your creation. Your friends are not going to believe you stenciled this yourself! This ethnic allover pattern is perfect for DIY decor. If you compare our stencil thickness, size, design quality and prices, you will be amazed at the value that Cutting Edge Stencils offer!This design comes with a FREE TOP EDGE STENCIL: the top part of the design cut as a separate smaller stencil. It makes it easy to fill the gaps in the pattern close to the ceiling.We also offer this design as a Stripe design. Check out our Otomi Stripe Stencil!Stenciling on rough or textured walls may contribute to increased paint bleed. For more information on stenciling on textured walls, see our F.A.Q. section.Stencil features an easy registration system, just use parts of the previously painted design to align the stencil, check for level and continue. This gives you a seamless &ldquo;wallpaper&rdquo; look. Don&rsquo;t worry about super perfect alignment: in the end your eye will never ever notice the discrepancy. We decorative pros &ldquo;fudge&rdquo; allover patterns all the time! The walls in most houses are often not straight, so some &ldquo;fudging&rdquo; while stenciling is very helpful and, in the end, not noticeable.Want to learn how to stencil an interlocking allover pattern? Easier than you think! Here are the detailed illustrated step-by-step Damask/Allover Stenciling Tips.And make sure you watch our short step-by-step Video Tutorials!You&rsquo;ll find them extremely helpful for your stenciling project. While prior experience is helpful when working with repeat interlocking stencils, even beginners get great results!Try this stencil with our new Clip-on Stencil Level, (sold separately) and discover how easy it is to achieve perfectly level results without dealing with all those bulky heavy bubble levels and annoying laser levels.We find that it is not necessary to use spray adhesive with our stencils, but for this tribal pattern it is highly recommended. If you want to minimize paint seepage or are using high contrasting colors, adhesive is very helpful (Elmer&rsquo;s spray adhesive seems to be the best). Make sure you shake the can well and lightly mist (not drench) the stencil, and let it dry for a moment before positioning it on the wall. This step will prevent the adhesive residue transferring to the wall. You&rsquo;ll need to re-mist the stencil after a few repeats. Clean-up tip: Spray the stencil with Simple Green to help to remove adhesive residue.Did you know you can stencil on fabric too? You can create custom stenciled curtains, pillows and table cloths with our stencils! When stenciling on fabric, stencil adhesive is very helpful. First, tape your ironed fabric to the surface so it doesn&rsquo;t move around while you stencil. Use stencil brushes, or roller, and add some textile medium (sold in craft stores) to your acrylic paint. You can also get a special fabric paint, but, frankly, good craft acrylics with a dollop of textile medium work just as well, and costs way less too! :) Texture medium will make the pain softer when it dries. Let the stenciled image dry completely, 24 hours is best, then heat-set it by ironing the fabric for about 20 seconds (more or less) on a LOW setting through the piece of cloth. Heat-setting will cure the paint and prevent it from being washed off in the washing machine. Always experiment with a sample of your fabric first to ensure good results. I&rsquo;ve stenciled on silk, cotton, linen and even sheer fabrics with great results. It&rsquo;s always better if your fabric doesn&rsquo;t have too much texture. We offer this stencil design as a Stripe, which can be perfect not only for walls but also for table runners!The stencil is made out of durable 12 mil clear plastic stencil material. This material is strong but flexible, reusable and easy to clean. We love it so much more than standard 5-8 mil Mylar! It&rsquo;s not brittle, user friendly and just so easy to work with. In our many years of professional stenciling this material has proven to be far superior to any other stencil material we used. Our customers love it too, and we are sure that you&rsquo;ll notice the difference! Our stencils will last a long time and are a pleasure to use.
