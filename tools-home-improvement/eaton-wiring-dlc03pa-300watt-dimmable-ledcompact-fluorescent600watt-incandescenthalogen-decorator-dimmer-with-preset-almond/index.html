With its preset feature, you are able to return to its previous setting when the light is turned on
Operates with Square Law Dimming, meaning the perceived dimming level is proportionate to the slider position
Simple to install due to its easy-accessible ground screws and virtually unbreakable top and back body and conveniently matches most decorator style wall switches</p><p>The Eaton DLC03P-A DEVINE dimmers help you solve the common problems with dimmable Compact Fluorescent (CFL) and LED lamps. They work great with dimmable LED and CFL lamps as well as traditional incandescent and halogen lamps. These dimmers match most decorator switches and the large slide tab lets you easily adjust the light level. Simply set your desired level of light and use the separate on/off switch to quickly return that same level every time. An easy-to-use adjacent wheel lets you fine-tune the performance and helps you eliminate buzzing and flickering, which are common problems with dimmable CFL and LED lamps. These dimmers can operate loads of up to 300W for LED/CFL lamps and 600W for incandescent lamps, and can be used in conjunction with another switch in 3-way applications. Eaton has tested these dimmers with 120 LED and CFL light sources, so you can be confident in the quality and performance of the product once it&rsquo;s installed. Set the right mood, save energy and extend the life of your lamps by replacing standard switches with Eaton dimmers. Eaton is a trusted name in electrical products. Eaton is committed to providing products that increase productivity, energy efficiency, safety at work and in the home, and produce reliable performance. Whether a home&rsquo;s style is traditional, modern, casual, cozy or rustic, it will demand more from wiring devices than in years past.
