Sanding blocks are just that, sanding blocks. They can be kind of handy but keeping the sandpaper on the block can be a bit of a challenge and they are altogether clunky to use.
Other new fangled “sanding blocks” have clips that sort of work until they don’t and even more types force you to buy expensive sanding belts to fit there version of a “sanding block”. It would be great if we just use the sandpaper most of us already have in our shops. Introducing the Sanding Mouse!
A one of a kind, ergonomically designed sanding tool that is so simple and feels so familiar in our hands, it’s a wonder why it took so long for someone to think of it. The Sanding Mouse is made from a sturdy, yet flexible composite material and has a hook and loop base. The Hook and loop base is designed to accept orbital sanding discs that most of us already have in our shop.
It will work with any hole pattern of sanding disc or even no hole sanding discs. Your hook and loop paper will easily attach and easily come off of the Sanding Mouse when its time to change paper or grits.
The sides of the Sanding Mouse are uniquely angled slightly inward. This helps when getting into corners of cabinets or anywhere you need to get up against a side wall of a project. It’s a tremendous feature that will help most all of us out when sanding book cases, cabinets, desks, counter tops and more. The Sanding Mouse is available in 5” or 6” sizes and are sold separately.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81+yj4IBn-L._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
