OTHER FEATURES: Unobstructed rear air intake, optimized internal air flow, and epoxy coated copper windings</p><p>The Metabo Pro Series Angle Grinder is a top-of-the-line tool, engineered and manufactured in Germany for durability, safety, and productivity. The grinder is designed to be versatile; including a tool-free, burst-proof adjustable guard for both metal grinding and masonry cutting applications. The powerful LongLife AC/DC motor delivers up to 50% more torque for faster material removal and up to 20% higher overload capacity for ultimate durability. The patented motor also includes features such as an unobstructed rear air intake, optimized internal air flow, and epoxy coated copper windings that extend outside of the field coil for advanced heat dissipation and protection against abrasion. The winding protection grid extends the life of the armature up to 5 times in harsh environments. Safety is a top priority with the Metabo S-Automatic mechanical safety slip clutch, which helps reduce the likelihood of kickback and allows the user to maintain control in case of an accessory jam. The ergonomic grip design reduces fatigue, while the rubberized side handle has a bulb-shaped grip and 15-degree offset for optimal handling, reduced fatigue, and improved ergonomics. This helps distribute forces evenly across the hand, lowering the risk of long-term work-related disorders of the hand, wrist, and arm. The die-cast aluminum gear housing is designed to dissipate heat from the motor and has oversized bearings and heavy-duty gearing. It is also rotatable, allowing for multiple switch positions.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61wzmVXLMjL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
