).
Designed with working professionals in mind, the Channellock 9-1/2-Inch High Leverage Linesman Plier (model 369) is also the only plier in the industry to incorporate a knife-and-anvil-style cutting edge, which ensures perfect mating and superior cutting edge life. It also utilizes Channellock&rsquo;s Xtreme Leverage Technology (XLT), which positions the rivet closer to the cutting edge so taht considerably less force is required to cut than other High Leverage designs.
Knife and anvil style cutting surface provides cutting precision.
The 369 can cut piano wire (0.47- to 0.091-inch thick), hard wire (0.047- to 0.091-inch), medium hard wire (0.047- to 0.091-inch), and soft wire (0.162-inch maximum diameter).
Channellock utilizes precision-machined knife and anvil style cutting edges to ensure perfect mating and superior cutting edge life. While most manufactureres use two sharp edges that can become misaligned and lose their cutting effectiveness, Channellock&rsquo;s knife and anvil cutters give you proper cutting edge alignment for a clean cut every time. The edge is also laser hardened for unprecedented edge life.
