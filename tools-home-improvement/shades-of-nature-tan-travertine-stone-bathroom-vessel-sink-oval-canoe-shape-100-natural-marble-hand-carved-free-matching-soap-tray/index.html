Color Details
This is a light tan color with shades of dark and light brown tones in between the grain lines, it also has very defined grain lines which is where all the different shades are seen, the grain will always be horizontal so that you can see the beautiful rings inside the basin.
Every sink is unique, crafted from natural stone, each sink presents a consistent hue as seen in our images, celebrating the stone&rsquo;s inherent beauty with every unique piece.
Stone is completely natural and we cannot manipulate its natural shades, but this color is very consistent with this stone and we do check every single sink and only ship them if they look absolutely beautiful and very similar to the pictures.
Sink Shape
Embrace the serene beauty of our handcrafted Oval Canoe-shaped bathroom vessel sink, a design inspired by the tranquil essence of Zen gardens. This exquisite marble stone sink, with its unique oval canoe form, brings an element of natural sophistication to your bathroom.
The raised sides gently slope downwards, creating an elegant profile that mimics the grace of a floating canoe. This design not only serves as a stunning visual centerpiece but also enhances functionality.
The curved shape provides more surface area, making it more practical for daily use while preventing water splashes. Its distinctive form, combined with the luxurious feel of marble, transforms your bathroom into a haven of relaxation, blending art with utility.
Stone Texture
Exquisite Craftsmanship: The interior and top of this sink have been meticulously hand-polished, revealing a radiant sheen and ultra-smooth finish like the finest semi-gloss paint. This careful polishing not only enhances the stone&rsquo;s natural vibrancy but also ensures an easy-to-clean surface, combining practicality with luxury.
Contrasting Textures: The exterior of the sink presents a striking contrast with its rustic, hand-chiseled texture. Despite its visually textured appearance, it offers an unexpected smoothness to the touch. This distinct blend of textures imparts a rich depth and character to the sink, transforming it into an eye-catching centerpiece.
Rich in Character: The sink&rsquo;s dual texture approach - polished smoothness on the inside and a rustic chiseled exterior - creates a harmonious balance between refined elegance and natural ruggedness. This striking contrast ensures that each sink is visually vibrant, effortlessly fitting into both modern and traditional bathroom decors.
Measure Your Space
To ensure a seamless fit, we recommend measuring your space prior to purchase. Note that our sink&rsquo;s generous dimensions surpass standard sizes, offering a grandeur that&rsquo;s widely admired, provided space permits.
Measurements are on top.

Installation
Our sink&rsquo;s design ensures a straightforward above-counter installation, making it a hassle-free addition to your space.
