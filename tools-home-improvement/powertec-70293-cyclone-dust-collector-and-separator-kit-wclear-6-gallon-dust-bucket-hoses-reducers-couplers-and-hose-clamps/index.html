This supplementary set offers an easy-to-use, lightweight and convenient assortment of dust collection components intended to prevent avoidable damage to your dust collector. The separator helps eliminate wear and tear by capturing and separating large wood chips, shavings and other harsh debris associated with dust collection and woodworking. It also cuts down on your container or dust bag from filling up so rapidly. The separator works by allowing heavy wood chips to fall directly to the bottom of the container, while the lighter dust particles get pulled in the out feed port and into your dust collector. Compatible and Versatile The POWERTEC Cyclone Dust Collector Separator Kit comes with a host of clamps, hoses and fittings made for dust collection and tool dust ports. Not only will it work with a variety of cyclone shop vacs and dust collectors, but it offers a limitless number of possibilities for maximizing your workflow and efficiency when planing. It’s ideal for industrial applications, woodworking tools and machinery, along with commercial workshop projects that require reliable results. Premium Build Each component features a high quality and durable construction for high volume and long-term usage.
