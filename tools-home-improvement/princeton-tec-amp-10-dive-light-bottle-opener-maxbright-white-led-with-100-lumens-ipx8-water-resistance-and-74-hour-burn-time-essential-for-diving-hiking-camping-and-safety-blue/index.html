Wight though Xylex housing and maxbright LED&rsquo;s, these handhelds don&rsquo;t belong in the kitchen drawer! The tiny Amp 1 gets a major power upgrade for 2016: a new 90 lumen LED. With a large carabiner loop, this handheld light can hang off of a gear loop on your pack; waterproof to 100M (330ft), Amp 1 LED is also at home clipped to your dive gear. When the adventure is over, this light still comes in handy with its built-in bottle opener.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81zAuyJ+mLL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://fabulous8.github.io/tools-home-improvement/printatoy-play-kitchen-dishwasher-panel-vinyl-decal-cooking-toy-appliance-sticker-matte-finish-5mil-25inchx95inch-45inch-x-6inch/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="PrintAToy Play Kitchen Dishwasher Panel Vinyl Decal, Cooking Toy Appliance Sticker, Matte Finish 5mil 2.5inchx9.5inch, 4.5inch X 6inch">&larr;
