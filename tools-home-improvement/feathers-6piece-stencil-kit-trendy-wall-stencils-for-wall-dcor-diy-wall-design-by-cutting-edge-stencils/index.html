Our Feather stencil kit has undeniable rustic boho influences and also can be used in woodland themed nurseries with native american indian tee pee decor. There is so much variety in our rustic Feather Stencil Kit! It contains 6 beautifully detailed feather stencils, each with it&rsquo;s own unique character. You can have hours of creative expression on walls, reclaimed wood, fabrics and furniture. So get in touch with your inner hippie and stencil some sacred tribal feathers in your space! Perfect stencils for small craft projects and even stenciled t-shirts!Our Feather stencil kit also allows you to create your own allover feather stencil pattern. You can create unique effects by overlaping the stencils, using different colors, adding shading, creating watercolor feather effect - the possibilities are endless! You can even make it somewhat 3D by troweling plaster through the feathers. You can stencil over flat or eggshell latex paint, plaster, faux finish background or even wallpaper if it is in decent condition. These feather stencils are so easy to use, virtually anyone can do it. Simply tape one stencil to the wall or furniture using BLUE painter&rsquo;s tape, then load your foam roller with the paint of your choice (latex or acrylic). Get rid of excess paint by rolling the foam roller over a folded paper towel. Then, just roll it over the stencil applying medium pressure for an instant fabulous result! Don&rsquo;t press on the roller too hard otherwise you might get some bleed. These boho feather designs can be easily stenciled with stencil brushes, using multiple paint colors. For expert stenciling tips, please watch our How-to stencil videos! You&rsquo;ll find them extremely helpful for your stenciling project. Even beginners get great results! Although most of our stencils do not require the use of spray adhesive, if your walls or wood surface have a texture, it might be a good idea to use spray adhesive to help minimize paint seepage (Elmer&rsquo;s spray adhesive seems to be the best). Make sure you shake the can well and lightly mist (not drench) the stencil, and let it dry for a moment before positioning it on the wall. This step will prevent the adhesive residue transferring to the wall. You&rsquo;ll need to re-mist the stencil after a few repeats. Note: you will still need to hold the stencil in place with a few pieces of blue painters tape! Adhesive by itself is not enough to hold the stencil on the wall. Clean-up tip: Spray the stencil with Simple Green to help to remove adhesive residue and let it sit for a while before cleaning with soap and water. Please note that it is virtually impossible to get rid of all adhesive residue. That&rsquo;s why we personally prefer not to use it and just stick with painter&rsquo;s tape! Stenciling on rough or textured walls may contribute to increased paint bleed. For more information on stenciling on textured walls, see our F.A.Q. section. About seepage and imperfections: Even with a proper loaded roller and correct technique you might get some minor paint seepage here and there. In most cases it&rsquo;s not noticeable, especially from a couple of feet away and it can be easily touched up with a small brush. Don&rsquo;t forget that you&rsquo;re creating a &ldquo;hand-painted wall finish&rdquo;. A few imperfections and some paint seepage here and there are natural and inevitable for this type of work. To avoid seepage, use spray adhesive and less paint on your roller and brush. Did you know you can stencil your own fabric and use it for curtains, tablecloths, pillows, etc.? When stenciling on fabric, please use stencil adhesive to ensure good results. First, tape your ironed fabric to the surface so it doesn&rsquo;t move around while you stencil. You&rsquo;ll get better results with stencil brushes, but sometimes roller can work too, depending on your fabric. Add some textile medium ( sold in craft stores) to your acrylic paint. You can also get a specially formulated fabric paint, but, frankly, good craft acrylic paint with a dollop of textile medium mixed in works just as well, and costs way less! :) Let the stenciled image dry completely, 24 hours is best, then heat-set it by ironing the fabric for about 20-30 seconds on a LOW setting through the piece of cloth. Heat-setting will cure the paint and will prevent it from being washed off in the washing machine. Always experiment with a sample of your fabric first to ensure good results. We have stenciled on silk, cotton, linen and even sheer fabrics with great results. It&rsquo;s always better if your fabric doesn&rsquo;t have too much texture. All of our stencils are made of thick, sturdy but flexible 12 mil clear plastic, reusable, easy to clean and stenciler-friendly! In our 20+ years of professional stenciling this material has proven to be far superior than any other material we used, including the industry standard 8 mil mylar. We are certain you&rsquo;ll notice the difference and will love working with it, just like all the folks who already bought our stencils. Our stencils are made to last and with proper care and storage will serve you for long time.
