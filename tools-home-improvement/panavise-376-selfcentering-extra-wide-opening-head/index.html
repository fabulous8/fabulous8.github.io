Ribbed, neoprene jaw pads are 1.875 (47.6mm) high x 1.5 (38.1mm) wide and provide a sure grip; reverse the pads and the wide V holds round or elliptical objects
Compatible with all 300 series Bases
Head Length: 11.5 (292.1mm). Height (shaft to top of jaw pads): 5.25 (133.3mm), Weight: 1.9 lbs. (0.9kg)</p><p>Product Description
The PanaVise 376 self-centering extra wide opening vise head features jaws that open up to 9", allowing any existing 300 series PanaVise base (sold separately) to hold small or larger objects without the need to change heads. Vise jaws are individual L-shaped elements, secured to the head with two screws. This makes the jaws reversible, allowing for a true &lsquo;zero&rsquo; closure required for very small items. Jaws are opened and closed via a &ldquo;double-action&rdquo; side crank mechanism that simultaneously moves both jaw ends towards each other, automatically centering them in the middle of the head. This ensures fast opening and closing, a good fit against held items, and concentration of the weight of items directly over the stem of the head, increasing the stability of the vise when working with heavier items. The unit ships with reversible/removable 1-7/8" neoprene jaw pads. One side of the pads has multiple grooves designed for flat surfaces, while the other side has a wide &ldquo;V&rdquo; groove to hold round or elliptical objects. To promote eye comfort jaws, guide rods and threads are treated with a black oxide coating to reduce glare in bright lighting conditions.

About PanaVise
Founded in 1957 by tool and die maker Otto Colbert and currently headquartered in Reno, Nevada, PanaVise is a leader in work-holding products. Over the years, a natural outgrowth of this expertise has been continued development of other items which hold things securely and offer a wide range of motion. Important areas in which this has been applied include, electronics, CCTV camera mounts, and audio/video mounts, earning PanaVise the nickname the &ldquo;the hold it anywhere you want it company.&rdquo;</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61i1itMratL._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
