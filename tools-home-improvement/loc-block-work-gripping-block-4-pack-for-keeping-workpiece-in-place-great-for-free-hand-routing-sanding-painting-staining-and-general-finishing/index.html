Our one of a kind Loc-Blocks make these jobs easy by gripping both your work surface as well as your project without the use of any clamps. This makes them perfect for sanding, drilling, routing, finishing and a whole lot more!
Not only do our Loc-Blocks hold your workpiece still, they also function as a project support by elevating your work, which provides easy access to every edge of your workpiece. This is great for finishing your projects with stain, paint, varnish and more.
What makes our Loc-Blocks work? The soft, receptive, anti-vibration, non-slip rubber pads on both the top and bottom of the blocks. These pads not only grip your work surface and workpiece, the pads also protect and will not mark or mar your wood. Use them on most any type of surface with most any type of work material like wood, plastic, resins, composites and more.
The Loc-Blocks can be attached to each other to create multiple gripping bases for multiple types of differently shaped projects. For example, you can attach 4 blocks in a single row for sanding narrow stock. You can also connect all four in a square for working square or even round stock pieces. They can also be used separately and be placed individually wherever needed under your project.
While 4 Loc-Blocks are great for a lot of projects, 8 or more is even better! The economically priced blocks can be used on projects large and small and its always better to have enough of them on hand. Remember, its always better to have it and not need it, rather than to need it and not have it! Loc-Blocks come in packs of 4.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81QOj4+w+2L._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
