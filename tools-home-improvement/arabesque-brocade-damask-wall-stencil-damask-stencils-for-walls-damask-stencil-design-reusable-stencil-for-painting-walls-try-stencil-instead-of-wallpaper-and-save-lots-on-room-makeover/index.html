Here are the detailed illustrated step-by-step Damask/Allover Stenciling Tips. Damask stenciling is not difficult if you follow our expert stenciling instructions. We&rsquo;ve stenciled many 2-story foyers in damask pattern, and with a foam roller it goes quick! And make sure you watch our short step-by-step Video Tutorials! You&rsquo;ll find them extremely helpful for your stenciling project. Even beginners get great results!You can stencil with acrylic or latex paint, stencil creams, glaze, etc. Use a foam roller or stencil brush. If you want nice crisp edges, using spray adhesive may be helpful (Elmer&rsquo;s seems to be the best) to ensure minimal bleed. The trick with stenciling is to take care not to over-load your roller or brush with paint and not to press hard on a roller while stenciling. I personally prefer just to use blue painter&rsquo;s tape instead of adhesive, but for beginners I would suggest using spray adhesive.All of our stencils are made of thick, sturdy but flexible 12 mil clear plastic, reusable, easy to clean and stenciler-friendly! In our 20+ years of professional stenciling this material has proven to be far superior than any other material we used, including the industry standard 8 mil mylar. We are certain you&rsquo;ll notice the difference and will love working with it, just like all the folks who already bought our stencils. Our stencils are made to last and with proper care and storage will serve you for a long time.Our professional decorative painting company, SpecFin Designs, has been a leader in decorative and faux painting for over 20 years in NYC/NJ Metropolitan area.
