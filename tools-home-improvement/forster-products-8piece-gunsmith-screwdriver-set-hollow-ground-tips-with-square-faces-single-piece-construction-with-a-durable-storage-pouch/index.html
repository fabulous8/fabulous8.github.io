DESIGNED FOR GUNSMITHING: Designed specifically for the mounting of scope sights and other common gunsmithing requirements, these Forster Gunsmith screwdrivers will be properly dimensioned to handle those unique tasks. Nothing is more frustrating than a bruised scope mount, a distorted screw, or the white metal showing through the finish of an expensive scope that has been subjected to a damaging mounting job.
HOLLOW GROUND TIPS: Hollow ground blades with square faces accurately fit screw slot for optimal torque, will not damage screw or chamfer work. Forster Products screwdrivers are not the double wedge type, swedged on a punch press.
SINGLE PIECE CONSTRUCTION: Each screwdriver is an individual unit, no sloppy inserts to slip in and out.
