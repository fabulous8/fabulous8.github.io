BENCH TOOL: This jeweler’s tool is essential for every work bench or studio. It’s lightweight smooth, measuring 6 inches (152mm) in length and made of wood that is sanded to a smooth finish. The center hinge allows use from both sides. The wooden wedge adds extra stability.
EASY TO USE: With this ring clamp, you don’t need to add pressure to keep the clamp closed. To clamp your ring, place it between the inner tips and lightly tap the wedge in at the opposite end. This will tighten the tips around the ring. When you’re done, remove the wedge.
JEWELRY MAKER: Suitable for a range of projects, this ring clamp can be used for holding parts when drilling, filing and sanding ring shanks & bands, holding wires for coiling or weaving, securing sheet metal for cutting and filing tubing edges flat for tube jewelry settings.

Lightweight and compact, this clamp can be easily stored on your workbench, small study table, or packed for travel to craft shows and classes. Made of sanded wood for a smooth finish, this 15 cm hand tool has a hinge in the middle and comes with a wooden wedge. The hinge operates with a seamless saw-like motion, and the wedge functions as a stopper to hold the ring in place at the other end. To use it, grip your ring or item between the tips and push the wedge into place at the other end. This creates tension, and the tips will securely hold the ring in place. Removing the wedge allows the two halves to move freely again. It&rsquo;s a safe way to keep your fingers out of the way when using sharp tools to create your piece. This is much safer than using pliers or other tools. This ring clamp is essential for your workbench or jewelry-making kit. It can be used to hold pieces while drilling, as well as filing and sanding rings and bands. You can clamp down a piece of metal sheet to cut or drill holes. You can also invest in some of The Beadsmith&rsquo;s metal element lines, which include quality tools for creating custom jewelry. Clamp your piece in the clamp and use our embossing or texturing hammers to form groove patterns on jewelry findings or blank sheets. This ring clamp is also great for repairing pieces. Use it to create custom earrings, bracelets, necklaces, and rings. Choose a new hobby, have fun making jewelry, or create gifts for family and friends.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UDYE6xUjL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
