Also included is a glue hub with hardwood waste block and a wrench.
GLUE HUB: Threaded, reusable, aluminum glue hub with hardwood waste block 6.5" diameter x 3.5" thick segmented bowl blank with center point for simple gluing Wrench for loosening hub from lathe spindle. Once you&rsquo;ve completed your turning, the glue hub and waste block can be reused for other projects!
HARDWOOD WASTE BLOCK: Arrives pre-glued to hub using clear Gorilla glue. Routered from kiln dried hard maple. 2.5" diameter x 1.5" long. Milled pocket is 0.50" deep, so your glue hub sits inside the waste block 0.50". Once your original waste block becomes 1" long, we suggest that you add additional fine-grained hardwood, such as hard maple, to the waste block. This will allow you to separate your project without consuming the original waste block.
WOOD BLANK: Comes already round ~ No Outside Roughing. Comprised of 2 maple segments, 2 walnut segments, 2 cherry segments and an ash base, all kiln dried. Measures 6.5" diameter by approximately 3.5" thick. Just glue to your waste block, allow to dry and you&rsquo;re ready to start turning. We always recommend using tailstock support as much as possible when turning. This can be done with a live tailstock chuck and a center point.</p><p>Includes: Threaded, reusable, aluminum glue hub with hardwood waste block 6.5" diameter x 3.5" thick segmented bowl blank with center point for simple gluing Wrench for loosening hub from lathe spindle Once you&rsquo;ve completed your turning, the glue hub and waste block can be reused for other projects! Finished bowl(s) not included, shown in pictures only to give an idea of what could be made from the bowl blank. Glue Hub Features: SIMPLE: Turn both inside, outside and bottom without removing and reversing project EXTRA SPACE: creates more room for shaping bottom or foot as it is smaller than a 4-jaw chuck and moves project away from the headstock SAVES WOOD: No need to lose wood on a tenon. Consume the waste block when parting your project off LONG LIFE: Add more fine-grained hardwood to extend waste block REUSABLE: Aluminum won’t crack or break over time REMOVEABLE: Remove project from lathe multiple times without losing center alignment. CONVENIENT: No screws or jaws. Thread hub onto lathe, glue your wood project directly to the waste block, use your tailstock to hold, and start turning once the glue dries. THREADED: Threads directly onto your lathe spindle, or can be reversed and held in tail stock. HOLDS SECURELY: Waste block features ½” deep milled pocket that the glue hub is glued into resulting in a more secure hold than a butt joint. No more coming loose from chuck jaws. LIGHTWEIGHT: Weighs 16 oz (with waste block) vs 4-jaw chucks that weigh 4+ lbs WORKS WITH RESIN: Without the waste block this can be glued or molded directly into a resin project. We always recommend using tailstock support as much as possible when turning. This can be done with a live tailstock chuck and a center point. Glue Hub Details: CNC machined from 6061 aluminum 1.90" outside diameter 3.5" Overall Length Choose from either 1" - 8 TPI threads or 1.25" - 8 TPI Hardwood Waste Block: Arrives pre-glued to hub using clear Gorilla glue.
