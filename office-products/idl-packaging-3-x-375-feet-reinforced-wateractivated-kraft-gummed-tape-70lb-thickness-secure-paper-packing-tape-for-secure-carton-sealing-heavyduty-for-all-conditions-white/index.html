White color, pack of 1 roll. It is a kraft paper tape reinforced with a layer of strong fiberglass yarn providing an extra margin of strength
100% TAMPER-EVIDENT BOND: Water-activated adhesive aggressively bonds with cardboard boxes once the glue face is wetted. With its high tack, the tape becomes one with the package it seals. Always leaves traces of damage on the surface after tape removal, preventing stealth theft. Ideal dependable option for packaging high-value products, such as alcohol and jewelry
RELIABLE WAY TO SEAL A BOX: The fiberglass threads provide an extra layer of robustness for the paper, ensuring that it won&rsquo;t burst under much pressure. Thus, this fiber-reinforced packing tape is perfect for sealing heavy boxes and for reinforcing their bottom, side, and top parts. Significantly improves the safety of items and protects your goods in transport
ANY CLIMATIC CONDITIONS: Our heavy-duty gummed tape works great in any climatic conditions, dusty or dirty environments. Strong adhesive withstands extreme heat except for the combustion point and shows high effectiveness in high humidity. Also, there is no minimum temperature that affects adhesion. The right choice for shipping, moving, packing, sealing, storing, and more
ODORLESS & ACID-FREE: Gummed kraft paper tape is not only an excellent alternative to plastic tapes but also causes zero harm to the environment. It&rsquo;s odorless and hygienic which makes it ideal for working with food or pharmaceuticals
WRITABLE & PRINTABLE: Any important information can be printed onto this kraft paper tape. Excellent base for marking, coding, logo printing, and even writing. The white backing is perfect for labeling items that need extra attention
