The Brause Rose nib is very flexible - this pen helps tame the nib so you get more out of it. You can also use other popular nibs in this pen, including the Zebra Manga G, Hunt drawing nibs, and our super Sketch nibs.
[Use any ink or paint] Most fountain pens are designed for writing with drawing as an afterthought. The purpose of our pens is to draw all day using your favorite ink and nib, and enjoy the experience. You can insert other feeds to work with Manga G nibs made by Nikko and Tachikawa, as well as inserts that let you work with smaller nibs such as crowquills and Gillott 303 nib. This pen has been designed for artists first, but can also be used for expressive writing and calligraphy.
[Fountain pens refillable] Use any ink, even India ink, also drawing inks and paints, such as Golden Hi-Flow. The large capacity ink storage area lets you draw all day and not worry about running out.
[Artist pens] You can expand the function of this pen by attaching our Brush Tool to the back of the pen. Just press it on when you want to use it, and pull it off when you don’t. Fill it with water or dilute ink to wash your drawings and maximize the expression of your drawn lines. Fill the tool with watercolor to add a touch of color.
[Drawing fountain pens for artists] We build pens that let you switch components on the fly. Replace the nib when it wears down or plugs up. Slip out the old nib and press in the new nib. Change feeds to get different flow rates. Work with any ink or paint. Express yourself using the nib and ink you enjoy.
[Classic vs Basic Fountain Pens] This is a Classic Fountain Pen, consisting of four pieces - the cap, body, barrel and reservoir - which provides a double wall of protection. Our Basic Fountain Pens consist of two pieces - the cap and the body. You fill the pen from the front - very easy, which makes our Basic Fountain Pens simpler and cheaper than our Classic Fountain Pens.
[Classic Fountain Pens vs Classic Pump Pens] We also provide Classic Pump Pens for this nib - same as our Classic Fountain Pens but with a pump. Press the pump to get a stronger flow, great when working with thicker inks and paints, when you want to fill in a large area, and when you want to kick start a new nib. Gravity flow works all the time, so you don’t need the pump - it just comes in handy sometimes. The choice is yours.</p><p>Draw, write and letter with a Brause Rose nib in our Classic Fountain Pen using any ink, even India ink, and all drawing paints. The Brause Rose nib is popular with many artists for its very fine line, extremely flexible tip, and wide line variation. You can remove the nib to clean or replace it - just pull out the old nib and stick in the new. Use other popular nibs in this pen, such as the Zebra Manga G nib, popular Hunt drawing nibs (22B, 56, and 101), and our Sketch nibs. You can also use our adapters to draw with crowquills and Gillott 303 nibs. You can switch the ink feed to provide different flow rates.
This pen is delivered with our standard feed, which suits most popular inks and drawing paints. Easy to change the feed, just pull out the old feed and slip in the new feed.
This pen has an attractive retro design, but the real benefits are in the internal configuration, so not obvious. The cap screws on and off, and the last twist locks the threads to secure against leakage. Expose the hole in the cap to release internal air pressure when you uncap the pen, then cover the hole when you cap the pen to seal against leakage. We use a material to which nothing sticks, so ink or paint won&rsquo;t dry out and build up. The pen is durable and solid, built to last a lifetime. You can drop this pen without fear of cracking or breaking it. The feed picks up ink directly from the reservoir so there are no narrow channels to plug up or clean out. Easy to clean, you can field strip the pen in half a minute. The large capacity reservoir lets you draw all day and not run out. Remove the reservoir to double your capacity. The tight threads prevent leakage. We’ve improved this pen over 20 years using feedback from artists who shared their opinions with us.
Attach our Brush Tool (listed on Amazon) to the back so you can wash your drawings with water or dilute ink, which maximizes the expression of your drawn lines. You can add watercolor.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617EHhkqnAL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
