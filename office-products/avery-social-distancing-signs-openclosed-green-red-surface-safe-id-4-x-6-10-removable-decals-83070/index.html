Created with a durable polyester decal material that is resistant to water, oil, chemicals, abrasion, tearing, surface cleaners and fading from UV rays
This COVID-19 signage adheres to a wide range of surfaces and is great for use on fabric office chairs as well as plastic, metal, cardboard and more
Using a specially-engineered adhesive, these Surface Safe COVID-19 signs stick and stay but peel away cleanly from smooth hard surfaces
COVID-19 signs for businesses are ideal for retail stores, restaurants, banks, airports, hair salons and more</p><p>Help your customers practice healthy habits using Preprinted Surface Safe ID Table and Chair Decals that are labeled &ldquo;Open/Closed.&rdquo; These informative signs quickly let people know which areas are available and which are not. Durable polyester material is water-resistant, chemical-resistant, oil-resistant, abrasion-resistant, tear-resistant, UV-resistant and resistant to most surface cleaners. Unique, removable decal adhesive will keep decals attached to a wide range of surfaces while also letting them peel off without leaving damage or residue. Decals are ideal for use on smooth hard surfaces, such as metal, plastic and glass as well as fabric office chairs, but not recommended for use on laminated wood, semi-gloss wood, leather and 100 percent polyester. Preprinted, COVID-19 signage is crucial for any type of business or location including restaurants, retail stores and airports. Pack includes 10 preprinted, 4" x 6" decals.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717QZWcOfGL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
