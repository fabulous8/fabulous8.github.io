However, when it comes to public places, price and security become more of an issue. What you need for high foot traffic areas is an enclosed cork board that keeps your announcements safe and secure behind the locked glass door ensuring that items posted can only be removed by those with the authority to replace them.
ENCLOSED CORK SURFACE: You can display 6 letter (8.5x11 inch) or A4 sized papers at a time. Use any push pins, thumb tacks or map pins to pin all of your notes, messages, pictures, memos, calendars, menus, reminders and more. Due to the dense board backing material under the board&rsquo;s cork surface, your push pins are firmly gripped and stay in place without falling out. The natural, self-healing cork surface hides push pin holes once the push pins are taken out.
DURABLE: This cork bulletin Board is made of the finest materials while providing the highest level of quality. The aluminum profile makes the product durable yet light for easy carrying. The anodized finish will protect the profile from dust and light scratches. Double lock bulletin board case depth is 1.18 inches. Shatter resistant polycarbonate door can be opened to 90 degrees. 2 door stays at each end help to keep the door open.
VERSATILE: Suitable for indoor use. Whether you will use these tack boards at schools to post announcements and grades or at business environments to display specials, memos, directions, rules, and messages, they will effectively deliver your message to students, employees, attendees, and visitors.
CONSISTENT CUSTOMER SERVICE: Feel free to ask any questions about the product and installation. We are always here to help. It is not difficult to mount the tack board through the four corner mounting holes at the rear. Buy one now, and immediately start using it with the provided free pins! Keep your important information safe and clean behind the glass door.</p><p>Announcement boards are great places to pin up quick notes or create a collage of your kid’s artwork at home.
