Lower back support for your chair or car seat is important. This ergonomic memory foam seat cushion, with a cooling gel layer, provides comfort and lower back support while sitting for long periods.

This contoured seat cushion is designed with a cooling gel layer on 100% pure memory foam. This memory foam is the same material used for high-end mattresses. Memory foam is heat responsive; the firmness of the cushion will change with the temperature in the environment in which it is being used. Memory foam will be softer in warmer temperatures and firmer in cooler temperatures; room temperature is ideal. The unique properties of memory foam allow the cushion to return to its original shape after use.
Created with premium features, this memory foam seat cushion is covered in a machine washable soft velour fabric with a zipper for easy removal. Ready to travel, this memory foam seat cushion includes a built-in carry handle for easy transport.
