is a flexible magnet mounted on a thin polyester film which has been coated on one side with an aggressive rubber-based pressure-sensitive adhesive. The tape is supplied self-wound on a semi-bleached kraft paper liner. The magnet is comprised of a multipole one face flexible magnet (composite of strontium and/or barium ferrite particles oriented with a thermoplastic polymer matrix). These permanent magnets remain magnetized indefinitely if not subjected to a demagnetizing force. This tape is
not returnable
for this reason.
This magnet has a thickness of 30 mils as noted in the product specializations so is slightly under 1/32 inch in thickness. As such it would not be able to hold up heavier weight items like heavy-weight fabric (see the 1/16 inch thick JVCC MAG-02 for heavier weight items). Through our own testing, we have found when the surface area of a 2-1/2 inch long x 1 inch wide strip weighs up to 0.5 pounds it is attracted enough to MAG-01 to be held up. One way we&rsquo;ve found to increase the magnetic attraction is to cut some MAG-01 into two pieces and then peel off the release liner to expose the adhesive side and then adhere to the two substrates. Then bring both magnetic sides together which typically creates a stronger magnetic bond.
As noted above JVCC MAG-01 is a single-faced multi-pole magnet so one side has a polarity and the other side is coated with an adhesive. The side with polarity would be attracted to ferromagnetic materials such as iron, nickel, and cobalt. It would also be attracted to a magnet of the opposite polarity. The tape is NOT attracted to itself (it repels) since it would need a magnet of the opposite polarity to attract.
NOTE: if your magnetic tape curls when you try to apply it to your surface, this is due to being wound in a roll and has no effect on the magnetic properties of the tape. Simply unwind and cut your piece from the roll, place under a weight (e.g. a book</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71srq4rrUQL._AC_SL1459_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://fabulous8.github.io/office-products/jvcc-premium-grade-colored-packaging-tape-opp26c-2-in-48mm-actual-x-72-yds-yellow/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="JVCC Premium Grade Colored Packaging Tape (OPP-26C): 2 in.
