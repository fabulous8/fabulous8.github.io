Mr. Nice Guy: Well&mldr; I try to do whats right. Narrator: Have you kept the Ten Commandments? MNG: Pretty much. Narrator: Really? Do you mind if we look at them? MNG: Ummm&mldr; all right. Narrator: Have you ever told a lie? MNG: Yeah, who hasn&rsquo;t? Narrator: What do you call someone who lies? MNG: A liar. Narrator: Have you ever stolen anything? MNG: Nope. Narrator: But you just told me you&rsquo;re a liar&mldr; MNG: Hmph. Well, I did steal some candy once as a kid. Narrator: What do you call someone who steals? MNG: A thief. Narrator: Have you ever looked at someone with lust? MNG: Of course. Narrator: Jesus said, &ldquo;Whoever looks at a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her in his heart.&rdquo; (Matthew 5:28) Narrator: Have you ever used God&rsquo;s name to curse? MNG: #$%@$! Watch it moron! Narrator: That&rsquo;s called blasphemy. &ldquo;the lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.&rdquo; (Exodus 20:7). Narrator: By your own admission you&rsquo;re a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. And that&rsquo;s just four of the Ten Commandments. MNG: OK, so I&rsquo;m not perfect. Narrator: Actually, its worse than that&mldr; sin isn&rsquo;t just doing things we shouldn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s also not doing the things we should. Narrator: &ldquo;Anyone who knows the good he ought to do and doesn&rsquo;t do it, sins.&rdquo; (James 4:17). Narrator: There&rsquo;s more&mldr; suppose we could put a device in your brain that would record all your private thoughts for a week&mldr; and then play them on a movie screen for your friends and family to see. MNG: that would be embarrassing! Narrator: &ldquo;God knows the secrets of the heart&rdquo; (Psalm 44:21). MNG: Well&mldr; compared to some people I&rsquo;m a saint! Narrator: True, but the standard is God&rsquo;s law, not other people. Narrator: Besides, even if you sin just five times a day&mldr;</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91c80N60dxL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
