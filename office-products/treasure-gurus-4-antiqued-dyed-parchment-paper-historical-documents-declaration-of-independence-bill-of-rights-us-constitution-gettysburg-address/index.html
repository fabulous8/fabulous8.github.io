A replica set of the Declaration of Independence, The US Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln&rsquo;s Gettysburg Address</p><p>The Declaration of Independence: Written by Thomas Jefferson, and signed on July 4, 1776 by all the delegates of the original 13 Colonies, this document was critical to the freedom of the United States from British Rule. Combining the specific with the timeless, Thomas Jefferson wrote about the abuses of a government ruled by a single king, and the self-evident and universal truths of freedom. Measures 16" tall by 13 3/4" wide. The US Constitution: Carefully crafted by members of the Constitutional Convention, the United States Constitution was written to protect the people from unfair forms of government. Studying other forms of government, the delegates learned from the mistakes of other civilizations and put in place a government with a system of checks and balances. Surviving as the oldest constitution in the world, this US Constitution replica document measures 18 3/4" tall by 12 1/4" wide. The Bill Of Rights: Although the Constitution had been formed, something was missing. These first 10 amendments to the Constitution provided individual protection. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine the constitution without the freedom of speech or the right to bear arms. The Bill of Rights measures 15 3/4" tall by 13 1/2" wide. The Gettysburg Address: One of the greatest expressions of American Democracy in the history of the US, President Abraham Lincoln delivered a dedication to the National Cemetery in Gettysburg. Trying to make sense of the violence, Lincoln searched for words to alleviate the suffering from the bloodiest battle in the Civil War. Starting with the iconic words, &ldquo;Four Score and Seven Years Ago&rdquo;, Lincoln&rsquo;s speech became one of the most famous in US History. The Gettysburg address measures 10 3/4" tall by 14" wide. Historical posters/documents are printed on antiqued parchment paper and ship brand new as a set of 4 with our 100% customer satisfaction guarantee.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71asOgNXSkL._AC_SL1200_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://fabulous8.github.io/office-products/treasure-gurus-antique-style-candlestick-phone-die-cast-pencil-sharpener/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Treasure Gurus Antique Style Candlestick Phone Die Cast Pencil Sharpener">&larr;
