Measure grip strength with the upmost precision using Baseline Hydraulic Hand Dynamometers! Our handheld dynamometers use simple hydraulics to test upper-body and overall strength at home or in clinical settings. Grip strength is a calculation of isometric muscle strength or the maximum force that’s produced by the forearm muscles. Measuring grip strength can provide insights into an individual’s overall health and condition. These measurements can also be used to help athletes improve performance and lower their risk of injuries. This device is ideal for measuring grip and hand strength, as well as evaluating patients with hand trauma or dysfunction. Our Baseline Hydraulic Hand Dynamometers are used to collect information about grip strength now and over time to track progress. Conduct evaluations with the confidence of knowing that Baseline Hydraulic Hand Dynamometers are built on exactness. Designed with high standards for clinical use, results are displayed in both lbs. and kgs. The maximum reading remains visible until the unit is reset. This dynamometer provides accurate grip strength readings without the subject being able to “feel” the handle move. All Baseline Hydraulic Hand Dynamometers have a five-position handle that adjusts to accommodate various hand sizes. After adjusting the handle as needed, the user will hold and squeeze the handle to determine their grip strength. For the best results, take three separate measurements and calculate the average. Durable and sturdy, Baseline Hydraulic Hand Dynamometers measure up to 200 lbs. of grip strength; some models measure up to 300 lbs. Products are USA-made, lightweight at under 5 lbs. and come in a protective carrying case that makes it easy to travel with. These products are made to last for years, which is why they are go-to evaluation tools for clinics and physical therapists. Choose from six available models; all models are made in the USA. Baseline LiTE (red), Baseline Standard (blue) and Baseline HD (black) all feature an easy-to-read 2.5″ dial and measure up to 200 lbs. Baseline LiTE comes with a one-year warranty, Baseline Standard carries a two-year warranty, and Baseline HD has a five-year warranty. Baseline HiRes Gauge (blue) also measures up to 200 lbs., but it features a larger dial (3.5″) and carries a two-year warranty. Both the Baseline HiRes Gauge – ER and the Baseline Digital LCD are blue with 3.5″ dials, measure up to 300 lbs. and carry two-year warranties. The digital model shows results on an LCD screen, though results are calculated using hydraulics like the other models. This model allows you to toggle between the current reading and the maximum reading and features an electronic zero calibration system. Includes one nine-volt battery.
