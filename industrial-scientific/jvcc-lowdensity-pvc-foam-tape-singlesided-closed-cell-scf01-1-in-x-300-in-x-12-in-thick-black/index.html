It is an economical, general-purpose foam tape coated on one side with a high-performance acrylic adhesive. The adhesive on this single-sided foam product is on the exposed side of the tape when you unwind it from the roll; the release liner is pulled away from the non-adhesive side of the tape.
A good combination of flexibility and conformability with strength & wear resistance. Also has excellent weatherability and chemical resistance. Used in applications requiring positive seals on irregular surfaces or when flexibility and conformability to seal tight radius curves are critical considerations.
Tape rolls are typically cut to standard tape industry metric-cut sizes - or approx 5% narrower than the nominal size (i.e. 24mm per 1-inch of nominal width ordered).
Adhesive: acrylic. Carrier/Backing: low density closed cell PVC foam. Release Liner: white siliconized paper. Service/Operating Temperature: -4°F to 176°F. Density (dependent on thickness): 6 to 10 pounds per cubic foot
Tensile strength: minimum 15 psi. Force to compress 25%: 3.0 psi for 1/16 inch thick up to 4.0 psi for 3/4 inch thick. Compression deflection (dependent on thickness): 1.0 to 2.5 psi. Standards Met: European RoHS directive 2002/95/BC. Core: 3 inch diameter</p><p>JVCC SCF-01 Single-Sided Foam Tape
is a low density, closed-cell PVC foam tape in thicknesses of 1/16, 1/8, 3/16, 1/4, 3/8, 1/2, or 3/4 inches. It is an economical, general-purpose foam tape coated on one side with a high-performance acrylic adhesive. The adhesive on this single-sided foam product is on the exposed side of the tape when you unwind it from the roll; the release liner is pulled away from the non-adhesive side of the tape. A good combination of flexibility and conformability with strength & wear resistance. Also has excellent weatherability and chemical resistance. Used in applications requiring positive seals on irregular surfaces or when flexibility and conformability to seal tight radius curves are critical considerations.
JVCC SCF-01 Foam Tape is used extensively in the automotive, HVAC and construction industries to provide air & weather-tight seals; for gasketing, cushioning, vibration control in speakers, vehicles, electronic components and door frames. Also for filling and sealing gaps around windows, doors, and car/SUV tops for better insulation. It is a clean, waste-free substitute for liquid sealants. Please make note that this a closed-cell foam product (to compress it 25% it requires 3.0 psi for the 1/16 inch thick up to 4.0 psi for the 3/4 inch thick); it is not soft like an open-cell foam product would be. It also complies with European RoHS directive 2002/95/BC. Country of Origin: Italy.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71W8o17d9zL._AC_SL1305_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
