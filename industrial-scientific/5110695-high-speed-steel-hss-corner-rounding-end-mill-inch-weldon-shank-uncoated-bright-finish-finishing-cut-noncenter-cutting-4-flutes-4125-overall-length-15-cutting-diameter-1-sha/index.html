Four straight flutes produce a fine finish
High-speed steel is compatible with a variety of materials
Uncoated (bright) tools have no additional surface treatment or coating for use on a broad range of materials
Meets ANSI specification B94.19 for quality assurance</p><p>The Union Butterfield 883 uncoated high-speed steel corner rounding end mill has four straight flutes and a non-center-cutting design for creating rounded exterior corners on a wide range of materials. This corner rounding end mill has a concave, curved indent on the cutting end to, depending on the radius selected, create more rounded or less rounded corners. It has four straight flutes to produce a fine finish.
High-speed steel (HSS) is a common general-purpose steel for cutting tools and is compatible with a variety of materials. With no coating or surface treatment, this uncoated tool can be used on a broad range of materials. The non-center-cutting design is for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing. The end mill has a Weldon shank that provides a secure hold in the tool holder and helps prevent slippage. It meets ANSI specification B94.19 for quality assurance.
End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the toolâ€™s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.
Dormer Pramet manufactures cutting tools under the following brands: Precision Twist Drill, Dormer, Union Butterfield and Pramet. The company has locations around the world, and provides tools adhering to ANSI, NAS, and DIN standards.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SY5jrBTEL._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
