Flat head has a flat top and a taper. Flat heads are designed to be used in a countersunk hole. Sheet metal screws have sharp threads that cut into a material such as sheet metal, plastic or wood. They also make excellent fasteners for attaching metal hardware to wood because the fully threaded shank provides good retention in wood.
About Self tapping Screws
A self-tapping screw is a screw that can tap its own hole as it is driven into the material.
Some self-tapping screws are also self-drilling, which means that, in addition to the tap-like flute in the leading threads, there is also a preliminary drill-like fluted tip that looks much like the tip of a center drill.
These screws in this auction are not &ldquo;Self Drilling&rdquo; and do require a pilot hole for a thick gauge material
