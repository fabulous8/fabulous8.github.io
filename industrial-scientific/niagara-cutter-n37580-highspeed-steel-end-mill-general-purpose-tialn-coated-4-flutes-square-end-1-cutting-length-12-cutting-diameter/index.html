Titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN) coating lubricates the end mill for high-temperature stability and abrasion resistance at high cutting speeds, offering better heat resistance than TiN and TiCN coatings
High-speed steel is compatible with a variety of materials
Square nose end mills (also called square end) create sharp, unrounded cuts
Center-cutting design allows the end mill to plunge into material like a drill bit while also performing conventional surface milling</p><p>The Niagara Cutter SC406 TiAlN-coated high-speed steel square end mill has a 30-degree helix angle for general-purpose machining on a range of materials. The number of flutes varies; fewer flutes provide better chip-carrying capacity, while more flutes produce a finer finish. The TiAlN coating resists heat better than TiN and TiCN coatings, increasing tool life and performance. It also offers increased hardness compared to TiN and may reduce the need for lubricants based on the application. (TiAlN is suitable for a range of materials, but TiCN or uncoated end mills are recommended for machining aluminum.) High-speed steel (HSS) is a common general-purpose steel for cutting tools and is compatible with a variety of materials. The tool’s square end creates sharp, unrounded cuts.
The 30-degree helix angle supports general-purpose applications. It balances lower angles’ strong cutting edge for difficult-to-machine materials with higher angles’ increased cutting action. The center-cutting design has cutting teeth at the end of the tool, so it can be fed into the workpiece like a drill bit, and used for applications such as profiling and slotting. The cutting diameter tolerance is +0.001” to -0.000”. This tool has a Weldon shank.
End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the tool’s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.
Niagara Cutter has been designing and manufacturing precision cutting tools since 1954. Specializing in end mills, cutting mills, and saws, the company is based in New York and manufactures its tools at facilities in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. This allows the company control over production, from substrate to coating, which is essential for customers in a variety of industries, especially aerospace and automotive.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71W+wOVKtFL._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
