Socket openings on each end for connecting three male pipes
CPVC for chemical and corrosion resistance, high strength, and better resistance to high temperatures and pressures than PVC
Operating temperature range of 0 to 93 degrees C (32 to 200 degrees F)
Meets ASTM D1784 and F441 standards for quality assurance, and meets NSF standards 14 and 61 for potable water service</p><p>This GF Piping Systems schedule 80 CPVC wye fitting has socket openings on each end, and is suitable for connecting and branching three pipes. The socket ends connect to pipes with a smooth bore for enhanced flow. The fitting is Y-shaped and connects three pipes through a main run and one branch line that splits off at a 45-degree angle. Pipe dimensions for wyes are represented as A x B x C. &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; indicate the main run on the fitting, and &ldquo;C&rdquo; indicates the branch. The fitting is made of gray CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) for chemical and corrosion resistance, high strength, and better resistance to high temperatures and pressures than PVC (polyvinyl chloride), making it suitable for both hot and cold water pressure distribution systems in residential and commercial applications. CPVC can be connected to other materials, such as steel or copper, using transition fittings. The fitting has a maximum operating temperature range of 0 to 93 degrees C (32 to 200 degrees F), meets ASTM International D1784 and F441 standards for quality assurance, and meets National Sanitation Foundation International (NSF) standards 14 and 61 for potable water service. This schedule 80 CPVC wye fitting is suitable for connecting pipes for conveying drinking water, waste water, chemicals, and other liquids in a range of industries.
Pipe fittings are components used for connecting, terminating, controlling flow, and changing the direction of piping in many different industries. When purchasing pipe fittings, consider the application, as this will affect material type, shape, size and required durability. Fittings are available threaded or unthreaded, in many shapes, styles, sizes, and schedules (pipe wall thickness).
GF Piping Systems manufactures piping components and systems for gas and water distribution. The company, founded in 1802 and headquartered in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards 9001:2008 and 14001:2004.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81XMxRQlEPL._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://fabulous8.github.io/industrial-scientific/cr-seals-skf-6925-single-lip-oil-seal-solid-0625-in-shaft-1250-in-od-0250-in-width-crw1-design-nitrile-rubber-nbr-lip-material/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="CR Seals (SKF) 6925 Single Lip Oil Seal - Solid, 0.625 in Shaft, 1.250 in OD, 0.250 in Width, CRW1 Design, Nitrile Rubber (NBR) Lip Material">&larr;
