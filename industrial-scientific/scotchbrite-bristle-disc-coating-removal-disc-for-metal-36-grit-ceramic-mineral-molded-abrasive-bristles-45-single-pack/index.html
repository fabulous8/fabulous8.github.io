Scotch-Brite Bristle Disc, using ceramic abrasive grain and molded, flexible bristles, provides more surface contact than wire brushes and maintains abrasive property throughout the life of the disc. The fast-running disc removes paint, stains, adhesives, weld burns, rust, heavy oxides, and surface contaminants from large areas.
From the Manufacturer
Scotch-Brite Bristle Disc is designed to last longer than wire and other abrasive discs and works well on aluminum, brass, bronze, carbon steel, cast iron, stainless steel, and other metals; and is used for general industrial, aerospace, automotive, metalworking, transportation, and automotive applications. Under normal use, the flexible bristles remain safely in place and can achieve the desired finish using light pressure.
These disks use a 3M ceramic aluminum oxide blend, which is a ceramic mineral designed to enhance toughness and hardness of the grain for a higher level performance. Ceramic aluminum oxide blend is engineered to fracture frequently and surpasses aluminum oxide abrasives in both cut-rate and durability. Perfect for moderate to heavy stock removal as well as finishing, ceramic abrasives are built to cut fast and handle intense heat and stress applications.
Scotch-Brite industrial abrasives are unique surface conditioning products with abrasives incorporated into non-woven nylon or synthetic fibers. Combining abrasives with the fibers creates an abrasive system that delivers consistent results for the life of the product. The open-web material runs cool and is load resistant, which keeps the abrasive minerals cutting at high performance by limiting clogging of the fibers.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/817QiYBUD6L._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://fabulous8.github.io/industrial-scientific/scotchbrite-clean-and-finish-roll-very-fine-grit-aluminum-oxide-bulk-abrasive-for-metal-finishing-and-blending-12-x-30-single-pack-maroon/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Scotch-Brite Clean and Finish Roll - Very Fine Grit Aluminum Oxide - Bulk Abrasive for Metal Finishing and Blending - 12 x 30' - Single Pack, Maroon">&larr;
