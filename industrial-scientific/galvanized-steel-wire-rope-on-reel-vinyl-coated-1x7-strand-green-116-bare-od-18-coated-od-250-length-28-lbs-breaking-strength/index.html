Vinyl coating helps resist abrasion and weathering</p><p>This vinyl-coated wire rope is for use as clotheslines, guy lines, and in lawn and garden applications, and is packaged on a reel for storage and dispensing. It is made of galvanized steel, which usually has a higher breaking strength than stainless steel and is coated with a thin layer of zinc that protects it from corrosion and provides rust resistance. Its 1 x 7 strand construction has one strand of wire rope with seven wires in each strand, formed helically around a strand core for resistance to abrasion. It measures 1/16" in diameter (1/8" with vinyl coating) and 250&rsquo; in length, and has a breaking strength of 28 lb. Its vinyl coating helps resist abrasion and weathering.
Wire rope, also called wire cable, is an assembly of wire strands formed helically around a central core. It is used for pulling, lifting, rigging, hoisting, and motion-control applications most commonly found in the manufacturing, marine, oil, mining, fiber-optics, aircraft, automotive accessory, and construction industries. A combination of characteristics including material, finish, construction, diameter, length, and breaking strength combines to give each rope its performance ability. Wire rope materials are selected for properties such as strength, elasticity, conductivity, and chemical- and weather-resistance. For strength purposes, most wire rope is made of bright (uncoated or bare) wire. However, it is also produced in a variety of finishes, such as polypropylene (PE), vinyl (PVC), or nylon. These coatings can increase overall durability and strength, and allow for specific use. The breaking strength for wire rope is the strength at which new wire rope will fail under a stationary load. Breaking strength is not considered safe working load (SWL) limit.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QntGuggDL._AC_SL1000_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://fabulous8.github.io/industrial-scientific/galvanized-steel-wire-rope-on-reel-vinyl-coated-7x19-strand-core-316-bare-od-14-coated-od-250-length-840-lbs-breaking-strength/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Galvanized Steel Wire Rope on Reel, Vinyl Coated, 7x19 Strand Core, 3/16 Bare OD, 1/4 Coated OD, 250' Length, 840 lbs Breaking Strength">&larr;
