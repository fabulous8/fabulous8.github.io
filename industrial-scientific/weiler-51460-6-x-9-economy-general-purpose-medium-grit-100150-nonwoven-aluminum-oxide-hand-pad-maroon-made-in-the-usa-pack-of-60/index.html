Unlike steel wool, hand pads are non-metallic, and do not produce &ldquo;after-rust&rdquo; on work surfaces. Hand pads can be used in wet applications. The various grades of non-woven products produce scratch patterns that can be compared to those produced by coated abrasive products. However, their pliable nature results in a softer, less pronounced scratch-line pattern. The strength of these products is producing decorative finishes ranging from satin to near-mirror polish. Denser non-woven products are suitable for applications requiring light stock removal such as removing large, well-attached burrs and blending minor tool marks and imperfections. All non-woven products are fabricated from base materials that are composed of a random “web” of nylon fibers that have been bonded together with synthetic resins and impregnated with abrasive grains. Although these materials vary in fiber density, their three dimensional nature results in specialty abrasive products that are pliable, conformable to the work surface, and limited in their ability to remove base stock. Non-woven products resist loading and perform consistently as new, fresh abrasive grains are exposed as the nylon fibers wear away from the product during use. Non-woven abrasives can be used either wet or dry on a range of materials including ferrous and non-ferrous metals, ceramics, plastics, composites, and wood. Non-woven products are designed for use where stock removal is not required. Non-wovens begin where coated abrasives leave off. Weiler is a family owned company based in Cresco, PA.
