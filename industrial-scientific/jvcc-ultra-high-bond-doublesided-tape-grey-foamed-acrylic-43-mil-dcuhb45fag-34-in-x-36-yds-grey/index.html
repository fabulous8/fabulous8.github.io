Ideal for structural bonding applications in the transportation industry. Used in automotive aftercare market and in body shops for crash repair as well as mounting/fixing car side molding and emblems
The pressure-sensitive acrylic composition has very good tack; has excellent adhesion to a variety of surfaces; and has high shear strength performance. The tape is carried on a red, release coated polyethylene liner that is easily removed. Has good UV resistance. The dwell time the tape needs to be in contact with both surfaces before it reaches its maximum adhesion is 1 to 24 hours.
This double-sided (AKA double-coated) tape will bond to most surfaces including many plastics, composites, sealed woods, and metals; however thorough evaluation is recommended when bonding to low energy surface material such as Polyethylene, Polypropylene, silicones, and Teflon. For lower energy surfaces may need to use an adhesive promoter/primer such as IPA (isopropanol) on the substrate prior to application.
Carrier/Backing: foamed acrylic. Adhesive: ultra-high bond acrylic. Release Liner: red polyethylene film. Thickness: 43.3 mils (carrier, adhesive).
Adhesion: 139 ounces per inch (to stainless steel test panel). Tensile Strength: 85 pounds per inch (longitudinal). Service/Operating Temperature: -40F to 212F. Dynamic Shear Strength: 85 pounds per square inch. Short Term Temperature Resistance: up to 320F. Core: 3-inch diameter plastic.</p><p>JVCC UHB45FA-G Ultra High Bond Double Coated Tape is constructed of a grey foamed acrylic system which has excellent all around bonding properties which allows for very high performance in the most demanding of applications.

For lower energy surfaces may need to use an adhesive promoter/primer such as IPA (isopropanol) on the substrate prior to application. When applying the tape after removing the release liner be careful not to contaminate the acrylic adhesive and try to immediately bond the tape to the surface without entrapping air between the tape and the surface it is being applied to. At a minimum application pressure should be 15 pounds per inch of tape width in order to achieve maximum bond strength. The dwell time the tape needs to be in contact with both surfaces, before it reaches it maximum adhesion, is 1 to 24 hours. If not otherwise specified widths shown in dropdown are in inches. NOTES: Sizes shipped will typically be the tape industry standard metric-cut sizes, i.e. 24mm for each 1 inch of nominal tape width ordered (rolls are approximately 5% narrower than the nominal size). This product&rsquo;s actual size is 19.0mm wide. The color name grey can also be spelled as gray.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CooRh1JCL._AC_SL1293_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
