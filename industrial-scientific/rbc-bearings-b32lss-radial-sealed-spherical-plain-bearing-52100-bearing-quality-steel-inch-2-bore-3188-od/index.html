Through hardened 52100 steel rings for strength and resistance to wear
Single fractured outer ring for simplified assembly and disassembly
Oil holes and grooves in both rings for lubrication in place
Lip contact seals on both ends to help retain lubricants and exclude contaminants</p><p>This RBC Bearings radial spherical plain bearing has seals on both ends and supports high oscillating radial loads, moderate axial loads in two directions, and moderate angular misalignments. The inner and outer rings are made of through hardened 52100 steel, which meets ASTM International standard A485 for strength, and the contact surfaces are ground and heat treated to a Rockwell hardness of HRC 56 minimum for resistance to wear. Surfaces are phosphate treated and coated with a dry film lubricant for static applications and occasional movements. The outer ring is single fractured (split) for simplified assembly and disassembly. The bearing has oil holes and lubrication grooves in both rings for lubrication in place. Lip contact seals at both ends help retain lubricants and exclude dirt and moisture. The bearing has a maximum operating temperature of 250 degrees F (121 degrees C). This spherical plain bearing meets American National Standards Institute/American Bearing Manufacturers Association standard ANSI/ABMA 22 for quality assurance, and is used in applications such as automobiles, construction equipment, and agricultural machinery, among others.
Plain bearings provide low-friction sliding contact for relative motion between parts of a machine. They are the simplest type of bearing, with no rolling elements, and there are three basic types of plain bearings: radial plain bearings (also called sleeve bearings or bushings) to support rotating or reciprocating shafts, thrust bearings (also called washers) to support axial loads on shafts, and linear bearings to support and guide the motion of parts in a straight line. Flanged sleeve bearings have a flange on one end to support axial loads. Spherical plain bearings are radial bearings that allow for angular misalignment of the shaft. Plain bearings are made from durable, low-friction materials such as sintered or cast bronze alloys, plastic, or a combination of a metal shell and a plastic bearing surface. They can be lubricated externally or by a lubricant embedded in the bearing material. Plain bearings are used in automobiles, construction and mining equipment, textile manufacturing equipment, and robotics, among others.
RBC Bearings manufactures bearings, bearing components, and collets. The company, founded in 1919 and headquartered in Oxford, CT, meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 9001 for quality assurance.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81P12tfqsJL._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://fabulous8.github.io/industrial-scientific/rbc-bearings-pitchlign-heavy-duty-needle-roller-bearings-and-inner-rings-tj7470111d/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="RBC Bearings Pitchlign Heavy Duty Needle Roller Bearings and Inner Rings (TJ7470111D)">&larr;
