This is a light duty anchor for use in solid materials such as concrete, brick and block, preferred when fixtures must be attached without chipping the fixture or the masonry.. Can also be used like a toggle bolt in wallboard or plaster, or as a blind rivet in joining several thicknesses of material together, especially in applications subject to vibration.
