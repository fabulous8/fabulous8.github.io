These Anthracite Coal nuggets make for some great real Christmas coal gifts. Also great for Snowman Accessories!
Anthracite coal is rare and makes up approximately just .2% of all US coal production. The largest deposits of Anthracite coal are found in the heart of Northeast Pennsylvania. That is where these coal nuggets are mined.
Anthracite Coal is superior to Bituminous Coal because it burns hotter and cleaner. The carbon content of anthracite is the highest of all coal ranging from 86%-97%. Anthracite coal produces little smoke or flame yet has a heating value of 13,400 to 15,600 BTU per pound. Unlike Bituminous coal, it does not coke and can be used as forge coal if needed.
Anthracite coal is also relatively clean burning, producing very little smoke and pollutants compared to other types of coal. Coal is Screened. This ensures you are getting the correct size of coal and no fine material.</p><p>Anthracite, or “hard coal,” contains the highest amount of carbon out of all coal. The carbon content ranks at 86%-97%. It has a brittle texture and lustrous sheen. Anthracite is rare in the United States, only making up 0.2% of coal production in 2017. The largest anthracite deposit in the country is in northeast Pennsylvania. Anthracite burns with little smoke or flame. It has a heating value of 13,400 to 15,600 BTU per pound. Its uses include mostly industrial and the metals industry due to its high heat value. Home heating is also a great application. It is a great source of heat for black smithing and knife making. Naughty boys and girls would also get a bucket of coal for Christmas. Great for gag gifts. Other applications include model trains, landscaping, school projects, and geological samples. This purchase includes a Naughty boys box of Anthracite coal filled with “nut” size coal. Nut coal is sized from 13/16" to 2 1/2" at the breaker. It is packaged in a plastic bag bag that is sealed to protect it from varying moisture. Coal is boxed in a 10"x10"x4" cardb board box. Anthracite is very brittle and continues to break into smaller pieces the more it handled by heavy machinery. Due to coal being very brittle, you will receive varying sizes of egg coal. There are no &ldquo;fines&rdquo; when package. Coal has been screened to exclude the &ldquo;fines&rdquo;. We are not responsible for intended or unintended uses or consequences arising from this purchase. Made in Pennsylvania, USA.
