Number of flutes varies by diameter for optimum feed and cut rate</p><p>The YG-1 E9990TF TiAlN-coated powdered-metal high-speed steel roughing square nose end mill has a fine pitch, multiple flutes, and a 30-degree helix angle for high-production metal removal on a range of strong materials, including structural steel, carbon steel, alloy steel, tool steel, prehardened steel, and cast iron. The end mill has chip-breaking cutting edges that create small chips for heavy cuts and remove material in less time than conventional end mills, with minimal vibration (chatter). It produces a rough finish that can be smoothed by a second finishing cut. The number of flutes varies by diameter to optimize the feed and cut rate. The tool’s square end creates sharp, unrounded cuts. The center-cutting design has cutting teeth at the end of the tool, so it can be fed into the workpiece like a drill bit. The 30-degree helix angle supports general-purpose roughing applications. It balances lower angles’ strong cutting edge for difficult-to-machine materials with higher angles’ increased cutting action.
The TiAlN coating resists heat better than TiN and TiCN coatings, increasing tool life and performance. It also offers increased hardness compared to TiN and may reduce the need for lubricants based on the application. Powdered-metal high-speed steel is tougher and more shock resistant than conventional high-speed steel and cobalt steel for higher productivity. Cutting diameter tolerance is + 0.0030 to - 0.0000" for end mills with a cutting diameter up to 1" and + 0.0060 to - 0.0000" for end mills with a cutting diameter over 1". This tool has a Weldon shank.
End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the tool’s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.
