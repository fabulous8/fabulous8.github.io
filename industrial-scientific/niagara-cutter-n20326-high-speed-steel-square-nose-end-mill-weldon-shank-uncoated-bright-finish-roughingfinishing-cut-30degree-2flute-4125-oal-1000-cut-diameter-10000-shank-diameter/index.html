High-speed steel (HSS) is compatible with a variety of materials
Uncoated (bright) tools have no additional surface treatment or coating for use on a broad range of materials
Square nose end mills (also called square end) create sharp, unrounded cuts
Center-cutting design allows the end mill to plunge into material like a drill bit while also performing conventional surface milling</p><p>The Niagara Cutter S203 uncoated (bright) high-speed steel square nose end mill provides the efficiency of two flutes and a 30-degree helix angle for general-purpose machining on a variety of materials. High-speed steel (HSS) is a common, general-purpose steel for cutting tools and is compatible with a variety of materials. With no coating or surface treatment, this uncoated tool can be used on a broad range of materials.
The tool’s square end has straight cutting edges that create sharp, unrounded cuts, while the center-cutting design has cutting teeth at the end of the tool that support making pocket cuts, profiling, and slotting. The end mill’s two flutes have better chip-carrying capacity than end mills with more flutes while offering additional support when the tool goes deep into the material in applications with a high depth of cut. The 30-degree helix angle supports general-purpose applications. It balances lower angles’ strong cutting edge for difficult-to-machine materials with higher angles’ increased cutting action. Cutting diameter tolerance is +0.001" to -0.000". The end mill has a Weldon shank.
End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the tool’s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.
Niagara Cutter has been designing and manufacturing precision cutting tools since 1954. Specializing in end mills, cutting mills, and saws, the company is based in New York and manufactures its tools at facilities in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. This allows the company control over production, from substrate to coating, which is essential for customers in a variety of industries, especially aerospace and automotive.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713pMmlfYqL._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
