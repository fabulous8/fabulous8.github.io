✅ TRIPLE LAYER DESIGN - Most other bags are single layer and aren&rsquo;t efficient at maintaining internal temperatures or will start to leak moisture. Our bags feature a sturdy thermal aluminum outer layer, an inner EPE (eco friendly plastic) waterproof layer and a final inner PE non toxic film layer.
✅ PROFESSIONAL GRADE - Professional caterers, delivery drivers and restaurant staff all use our bags to keep food at the perfect temperature for hours on end. They&rsquo;ll stay insulated even in hot cars or food trucks. All our top quality materials are 100% food safe and built to last for years of use.
✅ HEAVY DUTY LOCK CLOSURE - Every size bag has a durable hard handle and interlocking hard top closure that snaps shut in seconds and is easy to carry. The durable closing mechanism keeps your food fresh and insulated from outside temperatures (hot or cold) and humidity for hours at a time.
✅ THE SUPERIO DIFFERENCE - Here at Superio, we rigorously design and test superior home goods, organization and cleaning supplies. We constantly expand our product line and reinvent our existing products to make life easier for our customers&mldr;Click Add-to-Cart to Order your insulated bags Today!</p><p>Superio hot and cold food bags offer hours of professional-grade food storage perfect for groceries, lunches, day trips, camping, dinner parties—and of course for restaurants, caterers, and delivery drivers. Designed with three durable layers, this insulated cooler bag works two ways—keeping hot foods hot, and cold foods icy cold. Made of sturdy aluminum, eco-friendly EPE plastic, and a non-toxic PE inner film layer, this thermal bag is 100% food safe. With a convenient locking handle, Superio hot and cold food bags can be used repeatedly and keep food at the perfect temperature for hours—even in a hot car— making them a must-have for every household and food establishment. Reusable for Years Most reusable shopping bags and produce bags don’t insulate hot or cold foods or are simply too weak to use with heavy items like meat, ice, and vegetables. We use an industry-leading 3 layer design that makes these bags extremely durable compared to the competition. The outer aluminum layer insulates while also blocking UV rays and moisture. The middle layer is made from EPE plastic to further insulate and provide structure and seal in freshness. An inner PE film is food grade non-toxic and easy to clean. Multiple Sizes to Choose From Here at Superio, we offer 8 convenient sizes, so you always have an excellent option to choose from. Enjoy the square bottom bag (33cm x 18cm x 40cm), small flat bag (30 cm x 35cm), medium flat bag (40cm x 33 cm), large flat bag (35cm x 45 cm), XL flat bag (51cm x 49cm), medium double gusset bag (48 cm x 40cm +2x7), large double gusset bag (41cm x 49cm +2x7) and XL double gusset bag (51cm x 49 cm +2x7). Choose the bags that are best for your family or your needs.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81q2VOPLpHL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
