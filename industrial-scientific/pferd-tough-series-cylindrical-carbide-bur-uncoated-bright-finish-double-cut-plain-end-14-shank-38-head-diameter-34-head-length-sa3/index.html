Produces small chips and offers good operator control
Cylindrical shape with plain end (shape A) for machining with the side of the tool on flat surfaces
Uncoated (bright) tools have no additional surface treatment or coating</p><p>The Pferd Tough Series 3R impact-resistant double-cut carbide bur has a cylindrical shape with a plain end, an uncoated (bright) finish, and a 1/4" shank diameter, and is for heavy-duty machining on cast iron, steel with a Rockwell Hardness less than C55, stainless steel, nickel-based alloys, and titanium alloys. The Tough Series 3R impact-resistant double-cut design offers reduced risk of tooth breakage and more engagement between the tool and the workpiece than a standard double-cut bur. It produces small chips, and offers high stock removal and good operator control on recommended material. The bur has a cylindrical shape with a plain end, also known as shape A, which is suitable for machining with the side of the tool on flat surfaces. Carbide provides good wear resistance and maintains sharp edges longer than high-speed steel (HSS). With no coating or surface treatment, uncoated carbide supports a range of general-purpose applications. In most applications, burs should be operated within the recommended cutting speed range, expressed in surface feet per minute (SFPM).
Cutting burs, also called rotary files, are small rotary tools with many cutting edges that operate at very high speeds in order to remove material from a workpiece. The bur’s head contains the cutting edges, and the bur’s shank is inserted like a drill bit into a toolholder such as a drill chuck or collet. Burs are versatile tools that are offered in many shapes, sizes, and end types, and they are used in a wide range of industries, including tool, die, and mold manufacturing; metal fabrication; and dentistry. Burs can be used for deburring, or removing small protrusions (burrs) that form on the surface of a workpiece as a result of a machining process. They can also be used for welding preparation, finishing welded joints, chamfering, surface cleaning and finishing, grinding down rough edges, and contouring. A bur’s compact size gives the operator control over contact between the bur and the workpiece, making the tool well suited for delicate operations. Finishes or coatings may be applied to the head of the tool to improve wear resistance, decrease friction, and protect against high temperatures.
