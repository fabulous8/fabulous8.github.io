Product description 3M Scotch-Brite non-woven SC-BS sanding belt uses aluminum oxide as the abrasive material. Since this product is non-woven, grade is generally used to describe the abrasiveness; with the 00579 having a very fine grade. This particular 3M sanding belt is 2 in wide by 72 in long. From the Manufacturer The 3M Scotch-Brite Surface Conditioning Belt in very fine grade is a durable belt engineered to perform detail work such as blending, blending corners, cleaning, contour finishing, deburring, deburring edges, fine finishing, flat finishing, setting the grain, stainless steel finishing, and attaining straightline - brushed finish on a variety of metals. Very fine grade abrasive and high operating speed provides an effective means to achieve professional stainless steel finishes. The non-woven fiber construction runs cool, resists loading, and maintains edge durability while aluminum oxide abrasives provide a high cut-rate for consistent finishing performance over the life of the belt. The 3M Scotch-Brite Surface Conditioning belt works well to remove coarse grindlines, mill marks, or small burrs left by cutting tools or conventional abrasives. Thin width belts are ideal for blending and finishing right angle welds on stainless steel.The Scotch-Brite Surface Conditioning Belt uses course grade aluminum oxide abrasive. Aluminum oxide is a popular choice among industrial professionals because of its cut-rate and long life. This mineral is a tough, durable abrasive that self-fractures to expose fresh cutting edges in use, whereas traditional abrasives, such as garnet, quickly wear down with use. Due to its high cut-rate, hardness, strength, and low heat retention, aluminum oxide mineral is widely used in grinding applications in addition to sanding and finishing use.

The Scotch-Brite Surface Conditioning Belt uses course grade aluminum oxide abrasive. Aluminum oxide is a popular choice among industrial professionals because of its cut-rate and long life. This mineral is a tough, durable abrasive that self-fractures to expose fresh cutting edges in use, whereas traditional abrasives, such as garnet, quickly wear down with use. Due to its high cut-rate, hardness, strength, and low heat retention, aluminum oxide mineral is widely used in grinding applications in addition to sanding and finishing use. Aluminum oxide is suitable on a wide variety of substrates in both woodworking and metalworking, including ferrous alloys.
Belt sanders are used for rapid grinding, sanding and finishing on a variety of surfaces. Depending on the material being worked, sanding wheels and discs may clog, quickly making them less efficient, while belt sanders continue to sand without clogging because small grooves in the abrasive belt open as they go around the arc of the drive wheel.
