C3 radial clearance allows thermal expansion for continuous operating temperatures up to 120 degrees C/248 degrees F
Non-locating bearing (two ribs on the outer ring, none on the inner ring) for allowing outer and inner rings to axially displace relative to each other from the central position
Polyamide cage is lightweight and produces less noise and vibrations than brass cages
Removable inner ring in open bearing allows for lubrication in place</p><p>This FAG single row cylindrical roller bearing with a glass fiber reinforced polyamide cage and removable inner ring is suitable for applications that support high radial loads and no axial loads. It has a C3 radial internal clearance designation to indicate that the radial slack between the inner and outer rings is greater than CN (normal) and the press fit inner and outer rings can withstand a large temperature differential. This clearance allows for thermal expansion as the bearing supports radial loads and its cylindrical rollers reduce rotational friction. This cylindrical roller bearing can support heavier loads than bearings with comparable-sized ball bearings because the cylindrical shape of the rollers provides more surface area for distributing the load, and it also has a larger roller set than the standard roller design. This cylindrical roller bearing can be used to a maximum operating temperature of 120 degrees C/248 degrees F. The inner and outer rings and cylindrical rollers are made of a low-alloy, through-hardened chromium steel for durability, heat tolerance, and resistance to deformity under heavy loads. The bearing is non-locating, with two ribs on the interior circumference of the outer ring and no ribs on the exterior circumference of the inner ring, to allow the outer and inner rings to axially displace relative to each other from the central position. The glass fiber reinforced polyamide (PA66) cage prevents the rollers from coming into contact with each other during use to reduce friction, vibrations, and noise, and it weighs less and is quieter than cages made of brass. A removable inner ring in the open bearing allows for lubrication. This cylindrical bearing is for use in a broad range of applications where high radial loads are present, such as in conveyer belts, traction motors, railway car axle boxes, and oilfield mud pumps, among others.
Specifications
Main bearing dimensions DIN 5412-1 Basic dynamic load ratings DIN ISO 281 C3 radial internal clearance DIN 620-4 (ISO 5 753) Shaft and housing tolerances ISO 286 Through-hardening steel for inner and outer rings ISO 683-17 System for creating part numbers for rolling bearings DIN 623-1
Roller bearings use rolling elements to maintain the separation between moving parts to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. These elements can be one of the following types: ball, cylindrical, spherical, barrel, needle, spindle, or tapered. All roller bearings are open, shielded, or sealed. Sealed bearings are lubricated with oil or grease in the bearing factory, while open and shielded bearings are meant to be lubricated in place, with periodic reapplication of lubrication, based on use. The shield protects the working parts of the bearing from environmental debris that may be introduced and could reduce the ball bearing speed and lifespan. Rolling bearings are used in a range of applications from agricultural machinery to conveying equipment, robotics, dental equipment, elevators, rolling mills, ship rudder shafts, and aggregate crushers, among others.
FAG manufactures a variety of bearings that meet International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN) standards for quality assurance. Founded in 1883, FAG is based in Schweinfurt, Germany.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ozb8MPEVL._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://fabulous8.github.io/industrial-scientific/fag-nu310etvp2c3-cylindrical-roller-bearing-single-row-straight-bore-removable-inner-ring-high-capacity-polyamide-cage-c3-clearance-50mm-id-110mm-od-27mm-width/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="FAG NU310E-TVP2-C3 Cylindrical Roller Bearing, Single Row, Straight Bore, Removable Inner Ring, High Capacity, Polyamide Cage, C3 Clearance, 50mm ID, 110mm OD, 27mm Width">&larr;
