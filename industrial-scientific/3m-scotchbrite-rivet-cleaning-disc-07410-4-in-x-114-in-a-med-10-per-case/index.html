Scotch-Brite material resists loading and wears at a uniform rate to provide continuous cutting action</p><p>Product Description
The Scotch-Brite Rivet Cleaning Disc sands and cleans around rivets with high-speed efficiency and consistent results. This tough, tightly layered disc achieves a close fit against and between rivets and leaves behind a clean, consistent finish while maintaining the geometry of the workpiece.
From the Manufacturer
Efficient Results on Hard Metals
Use Scotch-Brite Roloc Cut and Polish Unitized Wheel to replace many conventional abrasive products such as rubber bonded wheels and small set-up wheels. It provides a consistent finish without cutting into the workpiece, reducing or even eliminating intermediate steps. Constructed with aluminum oxide mineral coated on a tough nylon web, this versatile wheel is well-suited for use on harder metals like stainless steel, carbon steel, and high nickel alloys.
The Ease of Roloc Attachments
For added productivity, a Roloc threaded attachment provides easy changeouts between steps on portable tools. The Roloc system allows for the use of both the edge and surface of the wheel without interruption of mounting hardware. 3M Roloc TR quick change discs are smaller discs that have a plastic threaded button or screw designed to easily and quickly screw onto a Roloc TR disc pad (sold separately) so that operators can easily change discs with a simple twist-off, twist-on motion. The Roloc TR system provides a secure attachment even for heavy-duty applications, and the variety of available 3M Roloc discs allows swapping from one application to the next in seconds.
The Scotch-Brite Advantage
Scotch-Brite industrial abrasives are unique surface conditioning products with abrasives incorporated into non-woven nylon or synthetic fibers. Combining abrasives with the fibers creates an abrasive system that delivers consistent results for the life of the product. The open-web material runs cool and is load resistant, which keeps the abrasive minerals cutting at high performance by limiting clogging of the fibers.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81mBoE2PRxL._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://fabulous8.github.io/industrial-scientific/3m-secure-grip-wire-connector-steel-spring-connectors-188-awg-straight-wing-design-red-sgr-pouch-of-100/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="3M Secure Grip Wire Connector, Steel Spring Connectors, 18-8 AWG, Straight Wing Design, Red (SG-R), Pouch of 100">&larr;
