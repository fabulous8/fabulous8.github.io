Liftex is the ONLY vertically integrated sling mfg in USA. This means you have a higher level of quality AND supply control than anyone in the USA due to weaving their own webbing. You recieve timely delivery from multiple Liftex manufacturing locations nationwide. Tested & proven world-wide. All slings meet or exceed OSHA, ASME B30.9, and WSTDA standards and regulations for strength and safety.
PRO-EDGE - UP TO 50 PERCENT TOUGHER THAN STANDARD EDGE SLINGS - Lifting professionals choose Pro-Edge protection to increase sling lifetime. Not only does Pro-Edge offer superior abrasion and slight cut resistance, but also offers the industry&rsquo;s most durable tagging system. Before considering Standard Edge or Import slings, try the sling TRUSTED BY EXPERTS for Quality Craftsmanship and Maximum Durability Tagging. Longer sling life. Increased safety. Trusted Slings since 1955.
LIGHTWEIGHT, STRONG - Compared to chain and wire rope slings, the user-friendly Polyester slings are lighter to maneuver, easier to store, more cost effective, and won&rsquo;t scratch or mar &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; loads you&rsquo;re lifting. The Type 3 Flat Eye web sling is versatile for all 3 hitch types - Vertical, Choker, and Basket. Unlike standard edge slings, Pro-Edge protection keeps your sling in service longer!
MAXIMUM DURABILITY TAGGING - A sling with an illegible or ripped off tag renders the sling &ldquo;out of service&rdquo; according to OSHA, ASMEB30.9 and WSTDA standards and regulations. Don&rsquo;t settle for low quality tags. Liftex web slings have a 2 Layer &ldquo;Pocket Tag&rdquo; for maximum durability protecting the required tag info. The laser-printed info includes Width, Length, Part No, and Capacities for each of the 3 hitch types (Vertical, Choker, Basket). Never use a sling without a tag and any required info.
CUSTOMIZABLE - These products are available in different lengths, load capacities, and styles. When choosing the product for your business OR personal usage, trust in the brand Experts choose everyday - Liftex. Perfect for Construction, Mfg., Boat Lifts, Yard work, Towing, Workshop usage, or simply moving some furniture.</p><p>Pro-Edge is different from most other premium edge slings in that the edge protection is structural – it is built into the sling. Pro-Edge features edge reinforcement with twisted tire – cord yarns – for the same reason that these yarns are used in tires – they provide maximum resistance to wear (cutting and abrasion). Additionally, the twisting of these yarns provides an enhanced degree of resistance to cutting and abrasion as compared to non-twisted yarns. Longer life means reduced cost per use. Most other premium edge products are made with non-twisted yarns and with vinyl or polymer edge coatings – coatings that can wear off over time and leave the end-user with a simple “standard” edge sling.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XmACxgwSL._SL1200_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://fabulous8.github.io/industrial-scientific/profit-2-in-roofing-electrogalvanized-nail-plastic-1-lb/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pro-Fit 2 in.
