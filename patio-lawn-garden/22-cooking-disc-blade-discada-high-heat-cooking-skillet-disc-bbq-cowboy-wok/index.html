Makes a great present for the hard to buy for man or woman. One of the hottest new cooking trends is cooking with one of these Discada Plow Disc Cookers over an open fire or on top of your turkey deep fryer burner or on your charcoal grill! These Discada&rsquo;s have been used for years to serve up some fantastic meals, they are heavy duty weighing in at 19 lbs and can withstand high cooking temperatures. Great for cooking your outdoor breakfast, a fajita lunch, deep frying, stews and more. The large 22" diameter cooking surface has plenty of room to cook for a group. This Discada is made from new Brazilian disc blade blanks with welded wire handles. They are coated with vegetable oil and as with most cookware of this type they will need to be cleaned and seasoned prior to your first use. Complete cleaning and seasoning instructions are included with each unit! Each unit is 22" diameter and is 3.5mm thick. Again these are new, never used disc blades that have been sealed with vegetable oil to prevent rusting. These Discada will need to be seasoned similar to a cast iron pan before the first use and periodically thereafter. As your Discada seasons it will perform better. It is normal for your Discada to smoke while being used and it is recommended only for outdoor use. Cleanup after using with a non scratching scouring pad or salt and a dish cloth. Remove stubborn food by heating the Discada prior to cleaning or by pouring hot water over the stubborn stains. Use as little pressure as possible when cleaning your Discada to prevent scratching, the use of dish soap as with cast iron cookware is not recommended. Dry your Discada after each cleaning. During use as with most items used to cook the handles will become hot and can cause burns, use hot pads or oven mitts to protect your hands from burns. Try this wonderful Pork Discada Recipe! Pork Discada By Sonia Mendez Garcia A Mexican Discada is typically prepared in a large disc like pan, similar to a paella pan. The traditional way to cook this dish is on an outdoor wood fired grill. It can be prepared with beef or pork, sometimes both. This recipe reminds me of those delicious guisados de carne that my Mom always prepared for us. All you need is some warm corn tortillas to enjoy this dish and all itÂ´s flavors. Ingredients 1/2 lb bacon, diced 4 cloves garlic, minced 8 oz Mexican pork chorizo 2 lb pork sirloin, cut into 1 inch pieces 1 tablespoon canola oil 1 medium onion, diced 1 Serrano pepper, minced 1 to 2 chipotle chiles, minced 1 Russet potato, peeled and sliced into bite size pieces 1 green plantain, sliced into bite size pieces 3 Roma tomatoes, diced 12 oz Mexican clear beer 1/8 cup Worcestershire sauce 2 teaspoons cumin 1/2 tablespoon oregano 1 teaspoon pepper Salt to taste 1/3 cup cilantro, chopped 1 cup crushed chicharrones, pork cracklins (pork rinds) Instructions In a large Discada, cook bacon at medium heat until crispy. Add the garlic and chorizo, and cook for 3 minutes. Turn the heat up, add the pork sirloin and cook until nicely browned and seared in most spots. If you need, add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the onion, Serrano, chipotle, potato, plantain and tomato, cook for 5 minutes. Add the beer, chicken broth (as desired), and stir well to combine. When it comes to a boil, reduce heat and stir in the Worcestershire sauce, cumin, oregano and pepper. Taste for salt before adding anymore. Stirring now and then, cover and cook at a low simmer for 45 to 55 minutes, until the sauce reduces and becomes thick. Add the cilantro and chicharrones to the top before serving. Serve with warmed tortillas, your favorite salsa, rice and beans.
