Tomatoes, peppers, strawberries, herbs, beans, and much more can all be grown wherever there’s sunlight! Just add potting mix, seedlings, and water; Each unit includes easy to follow instructions.
Self-watering and improved aeration – the self-contained system of the city picker is self-watering. It automatically waters plants by wicking moisture from its 2-gallon water reservoir and has water overflow holes to prevent overwatering. Additionally, plants rest above an aeration screen that enhances the oxygen flow to plant roots and encourages faster growth, which allows you to grow more with less effort.
Space saver – the city picker is perfect for homeowners with limited space who wish to grow plants and vegetables. It is less expensive than large, traditional raised bed gardens and can be used to introduce people to gardening with minimal investment. Even users in tight urban areas can use a city picker, as you can grow vegetables in small spaces, such as fire escapes or rooftop verandas
Weed prevention – the city picker alleviates weed growth by having its own self-contained soil system. A mulch cover is included to further prevent the development of weeds.</p><p>Enjoy gardening with EMSCO Group’s City Picker Raised Bed Grow Box!
