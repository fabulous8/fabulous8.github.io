They are each made using blown colored glass, so the color runs through the entire glass piece. The top finial decoration is made of cast iron. The stake is made of a solid rod of iron and unscrews about halfway. Each comes with two stake pieces allowing you to either use the full length and have it be 51" Tall, or use only the lower stake piece and have it be only 32" Tall.
All of the metal components are powder coated to help prevent rusting. The glass piece alone is 6" Tall and 4" in diameter at its widest. The connection between the glass and the stake is protected using a thin foam spacer to not only keep the glass safe, but also to keep moisture from entering the glass.
When you receive the item, it will be in 3 parts, the top glass and finial piece, the middle stake component (included but optional), and the lower stake piece, all you have to do is screw them together.
Dimensions: 4" x 4" x 51"Tall or 4" x 4" x 32"Tall (If you chose not to use the middle rod piece)
Glass is colored, not painted, preventing the glass from fading in sunlight.</p><p>These beautiful garden stakes are sold in pairs of the same color or as a set with an assortment of all six colors.
