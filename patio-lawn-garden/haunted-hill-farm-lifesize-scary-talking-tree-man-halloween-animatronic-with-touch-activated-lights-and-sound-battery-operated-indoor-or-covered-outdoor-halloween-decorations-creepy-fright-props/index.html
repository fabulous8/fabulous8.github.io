These blood-curdling creatures are sure to terrify any trick-or-treaters, coworkers, or customers. Terry the Terrible Tree-Man is, well…terrible. Cursed centuries ago, Terry was forced to live in a half-human, half-tree form. He’s out for vengeance and cares little about where his anger is directed. This Life-Sized monster is touch activated. When he senses victims, he laughs wickedly and taunts the poor souls. As he speaks, Terry’s mouth moves, and his glowing white eyes blink. His bendable arms are complete with skeleton hands, and his straw-like hair, knobbly face, toothy grin, and tattered cloak make Terry the most terrifying tree—or man—around this Halloween. Terry can torment visitors while suspended from his hanging loop or perched on his stand. It doesn’t matter to him, as long as there are innocent souls to terrify. Battery operated, he includes a stand and an optional hanging loop at the top of his head so you can display him however and wherever you want. For longer prop life, we recommend indoor or sheltered outdoor use protected from inclement weather.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fDQ1fpdGL._AC_SL1000_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
