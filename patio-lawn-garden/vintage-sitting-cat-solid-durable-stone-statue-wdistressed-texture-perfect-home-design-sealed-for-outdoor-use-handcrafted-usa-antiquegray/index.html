Material: It is made of a high quality, dense and durable concrete, using the finest cements, specialized aggregate and strengthening agents. It is the type of product where you can actually feel the immense strength. This is not &ldquo;faux stone&rdquo; or &ldquo;resin stone&rdquo; or &ldquo;light weight stone&rdquo; or &ldquo;magnesium oxide stone&rdquo;, this is real solid stone; if it is not solid then it is not stone. We incorporate a small batch technique which allows us to produce solid stone artwork with detail and strength where other manufacturers and materials fall short. The coloring is integrating directly into the mix and therefore is all the way through the product, making it blemish resistant. It cannot peel, bubble or fade as topical application will. Lastly the product is finished by hand and protected with a water repelling sealant and is outdoor safe.
