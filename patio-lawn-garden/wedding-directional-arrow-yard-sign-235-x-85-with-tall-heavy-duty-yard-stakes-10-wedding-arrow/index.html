Be Seen and Still Look Elegant - Our arrow sign is almost 2 feet wide so it&rsquo;s large enough to get noticed by your guests as they arrive to your wedding without being so large it seems to take over. Our signs measure 8.5” x 23.5” and are printed on both sides so they will be seen no matter from which direction your guests arrive.
Durable, All-Weather Signs and Stakes printed on both sides with fade resistant UV ink on 4mm Corrugated Coroplast - these directional signs are extremely durable in ALL weather conditions.
Strong and Tall sign stakes will hold your wedding signs in place. The 10x24 9GA galvanized steel sign stakes are Heavy Duty, Rust Resistant and are taller & wider than most so they will hold tighter to your sign, stay in the ground and stand taller.
Quick and Easy Way to Direct Your Guests - Our Wedding Arrow directional outdoor yard signs can be installed quickly and easily. Simply slide the sign onto the heavy duty Double H Step Stake, place it in the location you want then step down on the bottom rung of the stake to insert it into the ground!
