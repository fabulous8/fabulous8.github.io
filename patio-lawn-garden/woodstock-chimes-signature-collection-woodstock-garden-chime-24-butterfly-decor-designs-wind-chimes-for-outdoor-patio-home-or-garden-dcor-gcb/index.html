QUALITY YOU CAN TRUST: Created by Grammy award-winning musician and instrument designer Garry Kvistad, Woodstock Chimes offers a unique variety of high quality, affordable chimes, gongs, musical instruments and more that inspire, entertain and bring pleasure to people of all ages</p><p>MUSICALLY TUNED GARDEN WIND CHIME - BUTTERFLY. Tuned to a harmonious pentatonic scale, this chime features butterflies silk-screened on its richly colored blue tubes. Measures 24-inches overall in length - total hanging length is measured from top of gather ring to bottom of windcatcher. WOODSTOCK THE ORIGINAL MUSICALLY TUNED CHIME. Tuned to beautiful melodies and scales from around the world and available in a wide range of styles, songs and sizes, you can choose the Woodstock Chime that speaks to your soul. HOW IT ALL BEGAN - Garry and his wife Diane founded Woodstock Percussion, in 1979 and it remains a family-owned business in New York&rsquo;s Hudson Valley. Grammy award-winning musician Garry Kvistad created the first Woodstock Chime from an aluminum lawn chair he found in a landfill. As a professional musician and instrument designer, he was fascinated by the Scales of Olympos, a 7th century pentatonic scale that can&rsquo;t be played on a modern piano. Garry had the idea to cut and tune the lawn chair chime tubes to the exact frequency of the ancient scale. The resulting Chimes of Olympos was the first Woodstock Chime and is still one of our bestselling wind chimes.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51+-XV1V0wL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
