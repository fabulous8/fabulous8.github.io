MADE IN THE USA- Flock Fuel is a proud American company focused on creating high quality products. Every owl box is hand made in the heart of Midwest Missouri</p><p>There are several ways to attract owls to your yard or property: Provide a suitable habitat: Owls need a safe and comfortable place to live and hunt. Plant native trees and shrubs that provide cover, nesting sites, and food for owls. Offer a reliable food source: Owls rely on small rodents as their primary food source. If you have a rodent problem on your property, owls may be attracted to hunt them. Use a bird feeder: Supplement the natural food sources in your yard by placing a bird feeder filled with owl-friendly treats such as suet, dried mealworms, and seeds. Make your yard quiet: Owls rely on their keen hearing to locate prey, so a quiet yard is more attractive to them. Avoid using loud machinery or music that might disrupt their hunting. Install a nest box: If you have a suitable habitat and food sources, you can attract owls to your yard by installing a nest box specifically designed for owls. These boxes should be placed in a location with good visibility, and away from human activity.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81LpLZaOsmL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://fabulous8.github.io/patio-lawn-garden/flocked-welcome-mat-heavyduty-doormat-with-nonslip-rubber-backing-18x30-outdoor-indoor-entrance-rug-patio-door-mat-painted-fence/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Flocked Welcome Mat Heavy-Duty Doormat with Non-slip Rubber Backing 18x30 - Outdoor Indoor Entrance Rug Patio Door Mat Painted Fence">&larr;
