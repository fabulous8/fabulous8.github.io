Quick drain grommets offer a simple solution allowing water gathered on your solar blanket to exit back into the pool while trying to either roll up or take it off.
ALL POOL SHAPES AND SIZES - Comes with 6 individual pieces for any size cover. The positioning of the quick drain system is dependent on pool shape and when done will help you spend more time swimming and less struggling with getting into your pool.
ELIMINATE THE WEIGHT - The extra weight of water on top of the solar cover will be eliminated with the quick drain grommet set, reducing stress on both your cover and solar cover reel.
HOLD YOUR COVER DOWN - As an added bonus, these grommets help anchor your cover by enabling some water to rest atop the solar blanket. This comes in handy with gusty wind conditions where the cover may billow up at times.
SIMPLE INSTALLATION - The kit includes 12 individual plastic pieces used to quickly make a set of six grommets. All you will need to put these together is a hard and flat surface, a small hammer and the solar cover.</p><p>No more water hassle when removing your solar cover! Featuring a simple solution to allow water that has gathered atop of your solar cover to exit back into the pool while you roll up your cover. This is made for use with your above ground or inground swimming pools.
Small holes protected by heavy-duty grommets located throughout the solar cover are a pathway to drain water on top of the cover to ensure an effortless removal. This makes the solar blanket lighter and easier to use, reducing stress on both your cover and solar cover reel.
These grommets will also add years to the life expectancy of your solar cover since the extra weight on top of the solar cover will be eliminated which will make the cover simple to maneuver and reduces the stress and wear-n-tear of the solar cover. As an added bonus the grommet set anchors your cover for windy days.
This quick drain grommet system includes 12 individual plastic pieces used to quickly make a set of six grommets for any size heating cover. To construct a grommet, all you will need is a hard and flat surface, a small hammer and the solar cover.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71T+UiSYMtL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
