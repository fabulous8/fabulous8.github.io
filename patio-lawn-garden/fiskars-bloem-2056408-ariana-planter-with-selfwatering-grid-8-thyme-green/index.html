While various kinds of plants have different drainage needs, few can tolerate sitting in stagnate water for extended periods of time. If exposed to intense periods of rainfall or storms, your soil may not be able to absorb or evaporate the water fast enough..When the pot is in an unsheltered location we recommend punching out drainage holes. The process is extremely quick and easy with the right tools. Flip pot upside down and locate areas marked “X" for recommended hole locations. Then punch out holes by using either a drill with a drill bit or a hammer and a nail. The process should only take a minute or two, then the pot will be ready to fill with potting soil and plants of your choice.</p><p>ARIANA COLLECTION by Bloem: The planter waters plants when you’re not looking and helps keep your plants from drying out. Here’s how: Inside the planter, at the bottom, is a hidden reservoir that holds approx. 1 inch to 3.5 inches of water (depending on planter size). The self-watering insert keeps dirt and roots above the hidden reservoir line while constantly providing healthy “greenhouse-like” moisture through the evaporation process. If you’re forgetful, or you’re just not home very often, self-watering containers are a must-have. They’re also helpful if you’re growing in an area that’s not convenient to a water spigot, such as a balcony. How a self-watering planter works: the potting mix is held above the water line by a sturdy screen. The water chamber is connected by small porous channels filled with soil, which then acts as a water wick. As water is used by the plant or evaporates from the surface of the soil, capillary action draws more water up from base of planter. The soil has just the right amount of water all the time, but also maintains air pockets, which the plant roots need to stay healthy. Capacity: 1 Gallons / Size: 8.75 in. Top width x 5 in. Bottom width x 7 in. Height Constructed of high-quality durable plastic resin. Maintenance free and easy to clean. UV-protected for fade resistance. Sealed bottom to prevent leakage indoors. Optional knock-out drainage holes when used outdoors. Self-watering disk included. The disk helps to store reserved water, which can be used up by the plants at a later time. Plant will absorb water when needed.
