These blood-curdling creatures are sure to terrify any trick-or-treaters, coworkers, or customers. Cursed many years ago, Jacko lives for eternity in half-man, half-pumpkin form. Determined to scare any who stumble upon him, he greets visitors with creepy phrases and alarming shouts. &ldquo;Surprise! It&rsquo;s party time,&rdquo; he says. Jacko’s large pumpkin head lights up red as the smaller pumpkin clutched in his hand flashes an array of colors. His torn black cloak exposes his white bony rib cage, one of the only signs of Jacko’s humanity. Even his skeleton fingers are a shade of pumpkin orange. Battery operated and poseable, he includes a stand and an optional hanging loop at the top of his head so you can display him however and wherever you want. Place him on the front porch to greet visitors or in your living room to complement the rest of your spooky decor. For longer prop life, we recommend indoor or sheltered outdoor use protected from inclement weather. For thrills and chills so frightening that your neighbors will run shrieking in horrendous delight, count on Halloween decorations from Haunted Hill Farm.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81c7W3FCA4L._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
