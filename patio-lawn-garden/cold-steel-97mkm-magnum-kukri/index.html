There are very few knives in the world that we can think of that can out-chop or out-cut a good Kukri. It’s true that some of the best Kukris (like our model) can be somewhat expensive, and while that “thoroughbred” performs extraordinarily well, sometimes what’s required is a good, inexpensive, “workhorse” model – and our Kukri Machetes are those workhorses! Available in two sizes (one with thirteen inch blade and one with a whopping seventeen inch blade) our Kukri Machetes are ready to plow through the toughest chores! Perfect as a lighter-weight bushcraft or camping tool that can be carried on a belt or lashed to a pack, our Kukri Machetes pack a great deal of value into a relatively small, light and inexpensive package.

A reliable workhorse machete, the Magnum Kukri can out-chop and out-cut knives with far larger price tags. The Kukri&rsquo;s 17-inch blade features the same distinctive weight-forward balance as Cold Steel&rsquo;s top-of-the-line models, helping it handle the toughest chores life can dish out. The blade edge is also presented on an angle, so it&rsquo;s guaranteed to &ldquo;bite&rdquo; deep with every stroke. As a result, the machete is ideal for clearing fields, chopping tall weeds, and cutting through dense branches. Also outfitted with a sturdy polypropylene handle, the Magnum Kukri comes with a sturdy Cordura sheath.
