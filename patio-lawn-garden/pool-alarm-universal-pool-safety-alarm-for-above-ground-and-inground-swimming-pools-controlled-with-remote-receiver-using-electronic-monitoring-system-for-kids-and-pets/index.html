If a child or an animal falls into your unsupervised pool the SafetyTech pool sensor alarm for children sounds a loud pulsating alarm so that help can come as fast as possible.
EXCELLENT POOL ALARMS FOR INGROUND POOLS - Our portable, self-contained, and lightweight motion sensor monitoring system is easy to install by simply attaching it to the side of your inground swimming pool. If anything falls or jumps into the pool the sensors are triggered and it sounds a loud 100-decibel alarm.
IDEAL POOL ALARM FOR ABOVE GROUND POOLS - Unlike some pool monitoring systems the SafetyTech system can be easily installed on above ground swimming pools and hot tubs just as easily as an inground pool alarm. Have peace of mind knowing that your little climbers won&rsquo;t be able to go for an unsupervised swim.
COMPLETE WITH SWIM MODE and LOW BATTERY ALARM - Going for a swim? Simply switch on the swim mode so you don&rsquo;t trigger the alarm while enjoying your pool. When the battery starts to get low the remote unit will sound a &ldquo;low battery&rdquo; alarm so that you can keep your system active without interruption. SafeyTech pool alarms use very little energy so that two 9 volt batteries (not included) can last for up to one year without being changed.
TAMPER PROOF - If your toddlers and young children try to tamper with the device the alarm will sound so that you can ensure your pool is being monitored. We&rsquo;ve thought of every possible feature you need in a pool safety alarm so that you can enjoy your pool and keep your family and pets safe.</p><p>SafetyTech - Universal Pool Alarm for Inground and Above Ground Pools
The motion sensor monitoring system for maximum pool safety and security. Stay safe and protect your family and pets with our easy to install pool alarms for inground pools. It&rsquo;s also compatible with hot tubs, and any water with edges, and makes a perfect pool alarm for above ground pools. The SAFETYTECH pool alarm saves lives. In addition to laws requiring proper pool fencing and other layers of protection installing swimming pools alarms can make a critical difference of minutes in response time. Our quick and easy to install safety pool alarm is a secure plug-and-play device which comes with an intuitive and easy to read instruction manual. When the pool alarm is not on &ldquo;swim mode&rdquo; any entry into the pool by people or animals will be detected by the pool alarm&rsquo;s electronic motion sensor, triggering a loud pulsating alarm at the group and inside your house from the remote receiver.
