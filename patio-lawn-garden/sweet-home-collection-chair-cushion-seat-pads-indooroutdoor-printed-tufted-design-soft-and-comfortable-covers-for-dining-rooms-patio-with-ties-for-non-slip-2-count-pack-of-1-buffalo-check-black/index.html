TIES TO STAY PUT - We understand the frustration caused by chair pads when they don&rsquo;t stay in place. One of the most important qualities of a chair cushion is the ability to stay in place with frequent usage.

DELIGHTFUL LOOK VERSATILE DESIGN - The cover of these cushions utilize a printed tufted design that is a perfect fit for any decor. The available patterns are stylish and unique which looks beautiful on any chair. Conveniently available in 7 colors and prints, choose one to match your chair directly, or another color to accent the chair.
