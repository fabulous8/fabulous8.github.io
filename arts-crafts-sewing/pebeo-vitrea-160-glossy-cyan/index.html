CARING FOR YOUR CREATION: Before applying Vitrea 160, simply degrease decorated surfaces with alcohol or soapy water; Place decorated objects in a cold oven, heat to 300° F, cook for 40 minutes, then open the oven and leave the object to cool inside</p><p><em><strong>Let it Shine</strong></em> Pebeo has been a leading manufacturer of premium paint products for over 3 generations, developing professional-quality paints with superior formulations and limitless applications. Our Vitrea 160 high-gloss, water-based paints create a striking, luminous look with a transparent finish that can convert windows, glass, and crystal into a brilliant work of art. Our paints are designed to mimic the appearance of true colored glass for an authentic stained glass or tinted window effect. This innovative formula is a non-toxic, intermixable paint that comes in a wide array of stunning colors and finishes and can be used on any heat-safe, bakeable medium. Vitrea 160 can be used on a wide array of surfaces, including glass, crystal, ceramic, porcelain, china, glazed earthenware, terracotta, metal, enameled sheet steel, and copper, for a unique finish and distinct sheen. Our versatile paints can be used on surfaces as a glazing or decorating agent. Break the mold by creating and customizing your own beautiful dinnerware, decorating Christmas ornaments, painting vibrant, vivid designs on glassware, vases, mirrors, tea and coffee mugs, and other home decor items. These paints should be stored flat and protected from freezing and extreme temperatures to retain optimal quality. Before applying Vitrea 160, degrease surfaces with alcohol or soapy water. Place the decorated object in a cold oven. Once the temperature reaches 300° F (160°C), allow it to cook for 40 minutes. At the end of baking, open the oven and leave the object to cool down inside to prevent thermal shock. Once cooking is complete, your surfaces will be dishwasher-safe and resistant to solvents and common detergents. While accidental contact of decorated areas with food does not represent a health hazard, only surfaces that are not intended to come into contact with food should be decorated.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dgvu-VIeL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://fabulous8.github.io/arts-crafts-sewing/pebeo-vitrea-160-glossy-pink/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pebeo Vitrea 160 Glossy, Pink">&larr;
