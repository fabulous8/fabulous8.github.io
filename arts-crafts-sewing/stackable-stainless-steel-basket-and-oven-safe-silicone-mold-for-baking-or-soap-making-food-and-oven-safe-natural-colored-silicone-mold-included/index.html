Stackable Soap Mold Basket with Mold. Basket is made in the USA of quality Stainless Steel. Mold is made of Food Grade Silicone. R.E.D. Mold (color: natural or red) perfectly fits R.E.D. Stainless Steel Basket. Allows you to stack your cooling loaves on your work surface.
The revolutionary stainless steel soap mold basket was designed by Essential Depot exclusively for Essential Depot&rsquo;s R.E.D. Silicone Soap Mold. The basket provides the perfect support for your 11 inch loaf of soap or bread, even Lasagna or Shepherd&rsquo;s Pie or Moussaka. More importantly, you can stack several baskets (as depicted in the pictures and video) allowing you to conserve space as you make multiple loaves of soap. Then use your R.E.D. Cutter for evenly sized 1" bars of soap.
Please Note: The pictures which include multiples are for demonstrative purposes only and intended to show specifications as well as how the molds and baskets interlock/stack You will only receive what you order: a basket, a basket with mold (natural color), or a basket with mold (red color).
The welds from fabrication are not treated post-fabrication. Therefore, the discoloration at the weld points remains and is visible. However, this discoloration does not effect the performance of the basket. The discoloration is merely aesthetic. Removal of the discoloration adds substantial cost to the basket without improved performance.
With the Essential Depot Revolutionary family of products (the R.E.D. Silicone Soap Mold, R.E.D. Soap Cutter, and the R.E.D. Mold Basket) you are then equipped with all the tools you will need to make 1" bars of soap (eleven at a time, each perfectly and precisely cut).</p><p>Basket Outside Dimensions:
14.25" depth
4.25" width
5.75" height
1.5" of the height is the stacking ears so 4.25" height if you do not include the stacking ears
To calculate the height of the baskets stacked: multiply the number of baskets stacked by 4.25" and add 1.5". For example: 2 baskets stacked (as depicted in the image) would be (2 x 4.25") + 1.5" high = 10" high.
Mold Dimensions:
Interior:
11.25" depth
3.25" width
3.70" height
Exterior:
11.755" depth
3.75" width
3.941" height
Wall Thickness: .25"
Temperature Range: -40F - 536F
Will retain its shape after thousands of uses
Designed to make a 4 lb to 6 lb 11.25 inch long loaf of soap. You determine the height of the soap when you fill the mold.
Dishwasher safe but cold water wash/rinse recommended.
The welds in the basket from fabrication are not treated post-fabrication. Therefore, the discoloration at the weld points remains and is visible. However, this discoloration does not effect the performance of the basket. The discoloration is merely aesthetic. Removal of the discoloration adds substantial cost to the basket without improved performance.
