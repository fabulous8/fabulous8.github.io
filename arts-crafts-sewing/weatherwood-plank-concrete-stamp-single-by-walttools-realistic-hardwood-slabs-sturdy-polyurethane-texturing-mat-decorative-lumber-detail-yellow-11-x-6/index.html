The concrete mats were meticulously derived from century old dock planks from Lake Michigan, and will produce an incredibly rustic, yet detailed surface that looks like anything but concrete.
The individual planks are each just over 5 inches wide and are constructed into a side by side pattern of three different lengths (each stamp being approx. 11 inches wide). They are very easy for stamping in either a linear or stepped fashion.
Dimensions: 11 inch x 6 foot lengths (Plank width is 5 1/2”). Very detailed planks with rustic grains.
Like all stamps from Walttools, you can expect a professional grade tool with excellent fit and the heaviest straps used in the industry.
INCLUDES: one 6ft rigid yellow concrete stamp. Also available in sets - Just check our Amazon brand store! All concrete stamps will require the use of a release agent, either liquid or powder, to prevent them from sticking to the concrete.</p><p>Weatherwood plank stamps will unquestionably produce the most attractive wood finish in concrete that you can find.
