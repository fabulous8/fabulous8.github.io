With a 100-year tradition of innovation and continuous development, Pebeo’s top-quality formulas allow you to hone your craft and take your art to the next level. Whether painting is your hobby or a way of life, our professional-quality supplies are versatile and easy to work with. Bring your vision to life with vibrant premium paints that yield a creamy, enamel glaze on porcelain surfaces.
These water-based high-gloss paints can be used for a variety of techniques and purposes to help you achieve your desired finish, with superior formulations that stand the test of time. Our ceramic paints come in an assortment of translucent and opaque colors. Choose from glossy, shimmery, pastel, or chalkboard finishes and mix and match shades for a unique end result. These colors can be mixed, blended, and manipulated during painting to create a customized piece, and are designed to mimic the appearance of true glazed ceramics. Use on any porcelain, ceramic, china, glazed earthenware, tile, terracotta, metal, enameled sheet steel, copper, or glass surface.
Stir the product with a mixing stick before use. These non-toxic paints can be applied directly to a grease-free base after it is cleaned with alcohol or soap and water. Colors can be changed, removed, and layered until they are baked in an oven. After allowing the paint to dry for a minimum of 24 hours, place your creation in a cold oven and set the temperature to 300°F (150°C). After baking for 35 minutes, colors become permanent and are waterproof, dishwasher, UV, and microwave-safe. Migration tests have shown that accidental contact of decorated areas with food does not represent a danger to health; however, as a precaution, only surfaces which do not come in contact with food should be decorated. Paints must be stored flat and kept from freezing and extreme temperatures.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pAg3LKwjL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://fabulous8.github.io/arts-crafts-sewing/pebeo-porcelaine-150-ceramic-paint-blue/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pebeo Porcelaine 150 Ceramic Paint, Blue">&larr;
