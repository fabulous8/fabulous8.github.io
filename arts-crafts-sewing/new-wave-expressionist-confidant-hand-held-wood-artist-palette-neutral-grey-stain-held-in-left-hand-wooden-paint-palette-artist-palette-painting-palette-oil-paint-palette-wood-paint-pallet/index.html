From design, to wood selection, sanding, branding and finishing; we focus on the details during each step of the process.
Material: Hard white maple wood provides our paint palettes with delicate grain lines that will not distract you while mixing paint. In addition, our wood palettes are extremely light weight while providing the space of a large paint palette.
Patented Design: The 3 point design art palette provides a universal fit for all body types while distributing the wooden palette weight between the hand, rear forearm, and torso. This ensures maximum balance and comfort, and significantly reduces stress on muscles and tendons in the hand, wrist, arm and shoulder. Similar to the mixing space a paint tray palette design provides, the Expressionist Confidant offers ample space for mixing and allows you to work extremely close to your canvas.
Finish: The wood painter palettes are stained, then finished with a non-porous proprietary satin formulation that is dense, and resistant to water as well as standard artist solvents and mediums. In addition, the finish on our wooden paint palettes is crack proof, chip proof, non-yellowing, and freezer safe.
Dimensions: 20.44"x15.88"x0.19" Weight: 0.8 lbs</p><p>Compact, comfortable and conversational, the Expressionist Confidant Neutral Grey Stained palette is the perfect addition to the painting supplies of an artist who desires a smaller &ldquo;go to&rdquo; wooden palette in their studio. This open painter palette design features an open hand grasp to hold brushes or a mahlstick, and a lower quadrant that can be used for additional mixing, or to hold your medium palette cup and/or paint cloth. The surface area has ample room for color, and is ideal for finishing or detail work, being that the design will allow you to work extremely close to your canvas. Improve your color and value gauging with a neutral grey toned stain, while enhancing your mobility and focus while painting. All maple wood artist palettes are handcrafted in Pennsylvania, USA. From design, to wood selection, sanding, branding and finishing; we focus on the details during each step of the process. Proper Care: Best if used as an oil paint palette. Avoid digging your palette knife into the surface, and do not use a razor blade. Wet oil paints can be removed with artist solvents and a plastic razor blade. If using solvents on a New Wave wooden painting palette, follow proper care instructions provided by the manufacturer. Our patented 3 point design art palette provides a universal fit for all body types while keeping your wrist straight, and distributing the wooden palette weight between the hand, rear forearm, and torso. This ensures maximum balance and comfort, and significantly reduces stress on muscles and tendons in the hand, wrist, arm and shoulder. This model is for the right-handed painter.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CFu1u270S._AC_SL1200_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://fabulous8.github.io/arts-crafts-sewing/new-wave-posh-table-top-wooden-artist-palette-natural-stain-16-x-20-inches-fits-in-masterson-stawet-premier-and-artist-palette-seal-wooden-painting-palette-oil-paint-palette/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="New Wave POSH Table Top Wooden Artist Palette | Natural Stain, 16 x 20 inches, Fits in Masterson Sta-Wet Premier and Artist Palette Seal, Wooden Painting Palette, Oil Paint Palette">&larr;
