The newest trend in embroidery, now everyone can learn the beautiful art of Swedish or huck weaving with Leisure Arts Easy-Does-It books. The perfect craft for home decor or gifts.</p><p>Leisure Arts Easy-Does-It Swedish Weave Towels Book- Traditional Swedish Weaving is also known as huck weaving. This weave became popular in America in the 1940&rsquo;s when crafters used embroidery floss to decorate the borders of huck towels. Swedish weaving is usually done on a fabric known as monk&rsquo;s cloth. This fabric has a surface with raised threads that form squaresâ€”and allows designs to be symmetrical. Other fabrics with an even weave, such as Aida cloth or huck toweling, can also be used. You will generally use embroidery floss or yarn, along with a blunt-ended yarn needle, the size and type of which are determined by the size of the squares on your fabric. You will also need a pattern and a pair of scissors. Your pattern will usually give instructions on the type of cloth, yarn, and needle to use to replicate the pattern results. With a little experience, you will be able to adapt the design to other fabrics if desired. Today, Swedish Weave stitching can also be used to make table runners, afghans, pillows, placemats, and more. This instructional guide will not only show you how to complete 12 traditional patterns, but will also give you tips for success, floss guides, and more. Designs include: harvest stitch, Victoria, reflections, and more. 20 pages, soft cover.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81y2HWkAUdL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
