1-YEAR WARRANTY - 1-year manufacturer’s warranty which covers everything outside of normal wear & tear.</p><p>Protect your Slyde Handboard from the elements! This is our second-generation board bag and is a culmination of over 4 years of testing and finding out what fits, what works, and what protects your board the best! All the frills of the previous model with a few added features from lessons we learned. For starters, we made the second generation 4 inches bigger with a loading zipper to accommodate placing the leash in with the bag and a lot more great functionality, space, comfort, and protection. The Slyde handboard bag was designed and built with one purpose in mind: to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; your handboard! We did not cut corners or skimp on materials when designing this bag. This bag will last for years of heavy use. We guarantee it will protect your Slyde handboard from knocks, dings, and the elements. We have all broken zippers before and know how frustrating that can be! It ruins your day, so we used the best zippers double-stitched in those critical pressure points, reducing the risk of tears and breakage. If it does, by some chance, break, we will replace it free of charge. They say the devil is in the details. We took all we learned from what we personally wanted out of a handboard carry bag and applied it to this board bag design. From top-loading packing to allow for more padded tail protection to bigger wax and key holders to reduce the divorce rate after lost keys in the sand. PROTECT IT FROM YOURSELF. You are your own worst enemy! Drop it on the floor, leave it in the car in 90-degree weather, and beat your brother up with it. Put your board through its paces in the water and give it a break on land. Your board bag has a layer of protective foam sandwiched between the tough outer nylon and a protective inner tarp, protecting your cargo against knocks and dings. The heavy inner tarp lining keeps your board cool on those hot summer days.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hoCVWjW5L._AC_SL1080_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://fabulous8.github.io/sports-outdoors/smackdown-bank-pipe-rod-holder-fits-up-to-three-rods-in-each-rod-holder-for-fishing-from-the-shoreline/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Smackdown Bank Pipe Rod Holder- FITS UP to Three RODS in Each Rod Holder for Fishing from The Shoreline">&larr;
