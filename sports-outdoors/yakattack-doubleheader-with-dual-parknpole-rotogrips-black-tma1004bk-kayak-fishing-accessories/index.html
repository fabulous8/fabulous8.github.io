Features two ParkNPole holding RotoGrips - includes two SnapNStrap Security Tethers and two sizes of Track Disks compatible with YakAttack GearTrac, MightMount XL, MightyMount Switch, MightyMount II, and most other factory installed kayak tracks
Add LockNLoad accessories like YakAttack rod holders, camera mounts, and more by replacing the DoubleHeader stock knob with the LockNLoad base of a rod holder or other accessories and attach multiple accessories via a single attachment point
Compatible with 0.84” diameter stake out poles, the TMA-1004-BK DoubleHeader measures 8.5" in width and weighs just .5 lbs
Sold as a single unit - built for use in the harshest of marine conditions, made in the USA from marine grade polymers with a built for life guarantee</p><p>In typical YakAttack fashion, what started as an idea for a single offset RotoGrip Paddle Holder resulted in a product with a bit more versatility. The DoubleHeader track mount can serve several different purposes, but in this case, it is the foundation for the perfect offset ParkNPole holder that our customers have been asking for since the release of the DoubleHeader with dual RotoGrip paddle holders. Compatible with 0.84” diameter shafts, the DoubleHeader with dual ParkNPole RotoGrips has become a popular solution for kayakers needing a place to stow their stake out poles, but before customers had to buy the individual parts and assemble it on their own. Not anymore. The same as using two RotoGrips on a single piece of track for a paddle, you cover up the entire length of the track with your paddle, rendering open track space useless. The DoubleHeader in this configuration eliminates that problem entirely and offsets the ParkNPole RotoGrips from the kayak allowing for the full functionality of the remaining track space for other accessories. If you are tight on track space, the DoubleHeader includes an additional feature to add LockNLoad accessories like YakAttack rod holders, camera mounts, and more. Simply replace the stock knob from the DoubleHeader with the LockNLoad base of a rod holder or other accessories, and you are able to have multiple attachments on a short section of track or a single point of attachment like a MightyMount II. The DoubleHeader track mount is compatible with YakAttack GearTrac, MightMount XL, MightyMount Switch, MightyMount II, and most other factory installed kayak track. Included with the DoubleHeader are two different Track Disks. These two Track Disks are designed to provide a snug fit in either the standard YakAttack GearTrac (GT90, GTSL90, GT175, MightyMount XL) or the wider opening of the YakAttack Top Loading family of GearTrac (GTTL90 and GTTL175). If a track system came included with your kayak, try both of them and determine which one will provide the best fit. For added ParkNPole security, included with the DoubleHeader and ParkNPole RotoGrip’s are two SnapNStrap Security Tethers. To secure your ParkNPole, unhook the bungee tab from the stored position on the base of the DoubleHeader, wrap it around the shaft of your pole, and loop it over the tab on the outward side of the ParkNPole RotoGrip. The DoubleHeader with Dual ParkNPole RotoGrips is made in the USA from marine grade polymers and is backed by our Built for Life Guarantee. It features a single point of attachment and is LockNLoad Compatible. Additionally, it includes two ParkNPole RotoGrips, two SnapNStrap Security Tethers, and two sizes of Track Disks. This versatile product is perfect for offset ParkNPole storage and is compatible with 0.84"" diameter stake-out poles. The DoubleHeader itself is 8.25"" wide with a 3.5"" offset. The DoubleHeader track mount is compatible with YakAttack GearTrac, MightMount XL, MightyMount Switch, MightyMount II, and most other factory installed kayak track.
