Have a Seat – Anywhere!
Think back at all of the lines and waiting you&rsquo;ve had to do while traveling. Shuttle buses, airport gates, security lines&mldr;waiting is unavoidable and unfortunately it can last for hours on end! If you&rsquo;re on a line or in a jam-packed terminal, a seat is likely impossible to come by. The top of this frame can support up to 300 lbs. so don&rsquo;t be afraid of damaging your Zuca. Take a load off or use the super sturdy top to store and transport more gear.
Unique Wheel Design – Roll Almost Anywhere
Another great feature of this Sport Frame are the dual 4" polyurethane wheels. Almost every bag has wheels, but these are mounted vertically to easily handle being dragged up stairs or over curbs. They also absorb shock, roll easily on most any surface. Two feet are built-in to keep the bag stable when not in motion and are constructed of Nylon 6 material. It&rsquo;s super durable yet gentle on easily scratched flooring.
