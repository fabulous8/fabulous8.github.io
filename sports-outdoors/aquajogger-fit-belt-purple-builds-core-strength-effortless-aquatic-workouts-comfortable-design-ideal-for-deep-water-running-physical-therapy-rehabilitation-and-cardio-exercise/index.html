It provides exceptional comfort and suspends you at shoulder level in deep water allowing you to breathe normally and move freely while performing a wide variety of water exercises. The contoured shape of the belt ensures a snug fit around the waist, allowing users to maintain proper posture and form while aqua jogging. Foam dimensions 25 ¾” length 11” width 1 ¾” thick
RECOVER FASTER: In the water your Musculo-skeletal system is no longer bearing weight, so it can be recovering from all the pounding of your land-based programs while you focus your conditioning on the cardio-pulmonary system. No pounding…no impact
NO IMPACT RUNNING: Your body weighs about 10% of its land weight when up to your neck in water. If you weigh 200 lbs. when standing on land, you weigh only 20 lbs. in water. With the addition of a buoyancy belt like the AquaJogger, you can run with your head comfortably out of water, breathe normally, and accomplish most of the same workouts you perform on land
DURABLE & WATER RESISTANT: Crafted from high-quality, water-resistant materials, the AquaJogger Fit Belt is built to withstand the rigors of regular water workouts. The durable construction ensures longevity and reliability, making it a dependable choice for individuals looking for a lasting aquatic fitness solution as well as aiding in physical therapy sessions
PATENTED DESIGN: Our patented contoured design tones abdominal muscles and supports and strengthens the lower back. Whether used in a pool, lake, or other aquatic settings, the AquaJogger Fit Belt is versatile and adapts to various water environments. Its design allows users to engage in effective aqua jogging sessions in different settings, providing a flexible and enjoyable exercise experience. Includes 48" elastic adjustable belt that clips and unclips easily
EASY TO USE BUCKLE SYSTEM: The belt is equipped with a secure and user-friendly buckle system, ensuring a hassle-free experience when putting it on or taking it off. The quick-release buckle is designed for convenience, making the AquaJogger Fit Belt easy to use for individuals of all ages and fitness levels
MADE IN THE USA: The AquaJogger Fit Belt is proudly made in the USA</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xCvhvXCSL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
