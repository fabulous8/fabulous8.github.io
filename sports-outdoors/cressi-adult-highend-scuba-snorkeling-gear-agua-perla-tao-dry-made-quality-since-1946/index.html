It is made combining all the best that Cressi can offer in terms of quality, lightness and long-lasting use. The set is light, and the short fins can fit the carry on bag.

The lenses are made in tempered glass and anti-fog. It has a smaller profile and a slight tilt making the mask sit closer to the face. The Tao Dry is a dry snorkel that allows divers to take every breath with confidence and focus on the reef below not worrying about water in your airway. The top has a Splash Guard and a float mechanism that prevents the entry of water when submerged. A generous bore contoured tube provides ample airflow and a lower purge valve enables instant clearing when needed. The Quick-Release keeper is easy to use and allows attaching the snorkel to the mask strap, avoiding to lose on the surface or during diving.
