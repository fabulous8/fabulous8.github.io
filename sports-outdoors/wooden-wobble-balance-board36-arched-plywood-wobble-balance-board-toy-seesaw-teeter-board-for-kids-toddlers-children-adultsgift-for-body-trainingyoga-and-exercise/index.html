Would you like to bring the joy you had when you were a kid to your child now?
When we were kids, we had a lot of access to toys made of natural materials like wood, bamboo.
This is a well-polished balance board constructed by 10 layers of natural wood including birch wood and beech bark, stuck together and processed in a curved shape. It’s totally strong, non-toxic, odorless, safe and delightful. For kids, this wobble toy can be an interesting place to sit or lie, a bridge or a ramp road for vehicles in their imagination. For adults, it’s a simple yet practical auxiliary equipment which is helpful to exercise body coordination and flexibility like Yoga and Pilates. And due to the compact design, this wobble toy could be easily carried to anywhere.
As this world is full of modernized elements, it could be a good way of stepping close to nature by playing toys made of natural materials instead of killing time through computer games.
