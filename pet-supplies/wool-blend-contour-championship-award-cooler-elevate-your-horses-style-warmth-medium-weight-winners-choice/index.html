PEFRECT FOR WINTER – Adds another layer protecting your mare from cold climates while remaining comfortable to wear and easy put on
DRY FASTER – Keep your pony warm in colder temperatures after their baths or hard workouts as the cooler speeds up the drying process
LOOK LIKE A CHAMP – This attractive cooler is a perfect blend of form and function as the navy with bright red and yellow championship binding while the material quickly dries up sweat after workouts
HOOK & LOOP CLOSURE – The open front makes for a robe style application contoured through the chest and neck along with an adjustable surcingle ensuring a comfortable fit</p><p>Everyone who sees your horse wearing this will know you&rsquo;re a winner. Wool is preferred by many horsemen for laying down the coat more smoothly because of its natural oils.
Additional Details:
Robe style has hook and loop tabs for front closure
Detachable tail cord
Tremendous addition to your cold weather preparation
After a bath, scrape the water off, then puts the blanket on as the horse’s warmth helps heat the dampness starting the drying process quickly under this blanket
Doesn’t rub of their coat while helping keep it down
It is light but wicks moisture quickly and effectively
Cools out horse really fast and keeps the horse warm in extra cold weather
Great for layering on clipped horses after winter work-outs to keep warm while cooling down
How to Measure Your Horse’s Size
For best fit, stand the horse squarely
Measure from center of chest to edge of tail across widest part of the body
Determine size by taking the measurement and rounding up to the nearest even number
EXAMPLE &#187;> Horses measuring 72” would wear a Size 72
EXAMPLE &#187;> Horses measuring 75” would be rounded up to a Size 76
Proper Care and Cleaning
Machine wash in cold water on the gentle cycle
Line dry</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519HAnPpwJL._AC_SL1000_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
