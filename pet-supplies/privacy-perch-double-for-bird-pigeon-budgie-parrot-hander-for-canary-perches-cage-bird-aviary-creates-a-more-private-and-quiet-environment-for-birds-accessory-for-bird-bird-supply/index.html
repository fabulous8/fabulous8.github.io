Our plastic private perches come with a design that can be put together for better decoration and privacy for your feathered friends.
DESIGN: This double bird perch has a V shape that allows the birds&rsquo; droppings to not fall on top of each other. The base of the platform allows it to be placed on the wall of your aviary. It also helps your bird exercise the gripping muscles in its legs.
2Gr is a high-quality pet supplies manufacturer and distributor, specializing in creating excellent products for pets, both large and small, that cares about the well-being of your feathered friends.
Check that the perch is well balanced and hung at a height suitable for the birds. Pass a string, thin wire, or screw through the holes you made in the perch.
VERY IMPORTANT: Wash and dry the plastic perch completely to ensure it is clean and safe for birds.</p><p>Many birds, such as canaries, need privacy on their perch at night and more importantly during the molting season. They do not want other birds around them because it is not recommended that they be stung or mistreated when they are moulting to avoid mistreatment of their feathers. The Privacy Perch is perfect for ensuring they have their own space. Privacy Perch guarantees that they won&rsquo;t tear off or disturb you while you&rsquo;re trying to sleep. The V-hood ensures that droppings do not fall on birds at the bottom of the cage. The Privacy Hanger interlocks and stacks on top of each other when needed. Offers the most perching space in the least amount of cage space! Offering a private plastic perch for birds is a practical and economical way to provide a safe place for your birds to perch and rest. This perch is easy to install as it can be attached using a screw to a wall of your indoor aviary or using some wire to secure it to one of the walls of the cage or aviary. This type of plastic perch also offers a comfortable and private refuge for birds in your garden, providing them with a safe place to rest and observe their surroundings. It is important to ensure that all materials used are safe and non-toxic for animals and also offers a decoration for your garden or aviary. It is recommended to clean this perch whenever it is dirty to prevent diseases caused by the birds&rsquo; feces. Our store recommends using this perch since it is very comfortable and makes our birds free of stress since they cannot bother each other.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619JlPXhUiL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
