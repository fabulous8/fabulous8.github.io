The first months are memorable and you should enjoy them freely. However, puppies come with a smelly problem: they are not potty trained. In order to help you teach your dog the basics of living indoors, we have created a special washable pad that will completely hold any liquid while also protecting your floors.
EASY TO USE: All you must do now in order to take better care of your house is show your dog the proper place to do his job, on the extended pads. From there, the pad will take care of the rest: it will make sure no pee gets to your floors, while your dog will start using it immediately, being drawn to the fun brown& yellow colors.
WASHABLE: One of the best parts about the pads is that they are easy to clean and machine washable. This way, you can forget about buying hundreds of disposable pet pads that are not efficient and tend to smell quite badly, not to mention that they are a threat to the environment. Also, you can find great uses for the pads even after the dog is potty trained.
LARGE SIZE: Since it is not absorbent, we wanted to make sure that the pads will hold on to the pee, with no spills or leaks on the floor, which is why we have designed the pads to be extra-large, with a 27”x30” dimension. The pads also have many different uses, from an anti-fur blanket to a protection blanket for car trips.
MONEY BACK POLICY: After investing all our time and resources in a high-end product, we trust the quality of the potty pads. Yet, if for any reason you are not satisfied with the product, you will receive a full refund by only e-mailing the problem to us, with no questions asked.</p><p>These washable and waterproof dog pee pads are perfect for potty training and incontinence issues in pets. They are made of four layers of high-quality materials, including a super absorbent core, a waterproof top layer, and a non-slip bottom layer. The pads are large and easy to use, with a quick-drying design that makes them ideal for car travel. The pads are also hypoallergenic and odor-free, making them comfortable for pets to use. They are perfect for indoor and outdoor use, and can be used in crates, kennels, and on furniture.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7136O6NOHzL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
