Great for indoor use as it can prevent your furry friend from chewing at wires and carpets when inside

You can remove the bottom so your best bud has direct access to the lush lawn
Use the included ground anchors to secure to ground; easy to clean by simply wiping down the interior and exterior; includes two side pockets and an opening and holder for a water bottle; bottle not included</p><p>The TRIXIE Soft Sided Mobile Playpen can provide your little pal with a cozy and safe place! The fully collapsible design quickly folds down flat so you can store it in the included zippered bag, making traveling with your furry friend incredibly easy. Crafted from extra-durable nylon and a rubber coating bottom, this playpen can be used for both indoor or outdoor purposes—protecting your floors when used inside and water resistant bottom can withstand damp lawns when used outside. If your best bud prefers to explore the grass, you can even remove the bottom so he can play directly on the lawn! The pen includes straps and anchors that will secure it to the ground as well as a removable net cover so your pal can’t jump out. Additional features include a removable net cover to prevent pets from jumping out, two side pockets and opening for a drinking bottle. Easy to clean by wiping away any messes with a damp cloth. The removable net and nylon bottom are hand washable. Quick and easy to pop up!</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xHAXvBGCL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
