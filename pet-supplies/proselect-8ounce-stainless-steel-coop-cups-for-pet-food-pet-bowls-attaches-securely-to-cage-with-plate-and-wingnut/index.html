8-Ounce Bowl – This ProSelect stainless steel pet food bowl has an 8-ounce capacity, although three larger sizes up to 64 ounces are available
Easy to Clean – The stainless steel construction of this bowl is easy to clean and remains durable, no matter how rough the pet treats the bowl
Fast Installation – You can easily attach and remove the ProSelect coop cups within a matter of seconds
Works Well for Anything – You can use these stainless steel pet bowls for food, water or treats</p><p>If your pet treats its food and water bowls roughly, commonly spilling them inside its kennel, the ProSelect 8-Ounce Stainless Steel Coop Cups provides a solution by attaching directly to the cage, remaining off the floor. The stainless steel bowls attach to the cage with a metal plate and wingnut, ensuring the pet can’t knock it off the cage. Even with a secure attachment design, you can remove the bowl for cleaning within a matter of seconds. The 8-ounce ProSelect stainless steel bowl can hold about 1 cup of food or water. The 14/4 stainless steel construction of the bowl consists of 14% chrome and 4% nickel, meaning it won’t chip or rust.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nIlXTO3UL._AC_SL1000_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://fabulous8.github.io/pet-supplies/proselect-88inch-modular-kennel-cage-base-with-wheel-large/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="ProSelect 88-Inch Modular Kennel Cage Base with Wheel, Large">&larr;
